The Hummus factory menu is very similar to Hedary, so I ordered what I often get at Hedary:  Kafta skewers and lentil soup.  I have no complaints about what I got. It was good, but it wasn't as good as Hedary. The rice was OK but not as good as Hedary's (which is excellent). The pita bread, too, was good and fresh, but not as good as Hedary. Hedary is just a couple of blocks away from Hummus Factory, so I'll go there. To respond to owner's comment: I agree with your reference to Chinatown, so maybe the congregation of Mediterranean restaurants is a similar concept. However, regardless of the origination of the recipes, if you choose to locate your restaurant a few blocks from Hedary's, and maintain a similar menu, you should expect your restaurant to be compared directly to Hedary's.

pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"""Nobu""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"The teppan table at Nobu was one of the top  or  meals of my life.  We had a  pm reservation on a Friday night.  This was the th time my buddy and I had reserved the teppan table.  The previous  we had been bumped for high rollers, so I was wondering if we would even get the table at all.  Fortunately for us, we did.   There are  teppan tables in Nobu with  seats each.  There were only  of us and no one joined us, so we were able to spread out and all had a good view of the chef.  The tables are kind of separated from the restaurant, so it's a much more intimate feel.  When we left, I was surprised to see a completely full restaurant buzzing with activity, that's how isolated you are from the regular dining room.   Our server (Andrew, who was fantastic) explained the menu to us.  They offer ala carte ordering, but like most teppan joints you've been to, most people chose a tasting menu.  They have several levels:  $, $, $, $ and the reasonable $, which is a wagyu tasting menu that must be ordered in advance.  Given how good our meal was, I can only imagine how the $ would be.  I am sure on my next trip to Vegas I'll hit a progressive and try it.  Our table of  decided on the $ menu, but with crab fried rice instead of chicken fried rice.  Additionally,  in our party added a seared foie gras bun, which was $.  The wine list at Nobu is solid for Vegas.  The somm was great, we ordered a magnum of cab and when he didn't have the bottle, he offered us  bottles of a better vintage for the same price.  What Nobu does have is (as expected) a great Japanese whiskey selection.   of us went with the $ flight and I am very glad I did.  All  whiskeys were fantastic, and it got me curious about Japanese whiskeys, which have been receiving high praise for some time now.  I don't think I have enough room in this review to adequately describe every dish, so I will give you what we had and then highlight a few items.  This is what the $ tasting menu came with at our visit:  blistered Shishito, Yellowtail Tartare, Sashimi Salad, Japanese Scallop, Chilean Seabass, Japanese Wagyu, King Crab Tempura, Scallop in Cilantro Sauce, crab fried rice (usually chicken) and a coffee flavored dessert with whiskey foam.  The Japanese wagyu was my favorite of the evening, and the second best steak I've had in my life (after the riserve ribeye at Carnevino for those keeping score at home).  It was filled with veins of fat that melted into flavor during cooking.  It is served with  sauces, but I only tried  of them and didn't use them during the meal.  The steak is too good to mask with sauce, even sauces as good as these.  Additionally, it is served with an asparagus and mushroom salad, soy salt, and fried garlic.  The fried garlic was fantastic (it's the stuff that looks like tiny cornflakes in the picture).  I had every intention of copying this at home, until I found out that the process takes over  hours.  I could eat a full bowl of this stuff.  A bite of the steak with fried garlic and some soy salt was the best bite of my  nights in Las Vegas.  To be honest, probably one of the better bites of my life.  I don't know if a $  bite sandwich can be called a bargain, but the seared foie gras was.  Of course it's ridiculously expensive, that's the markup you pay for eating on the Las Vegas strip at an iconic Japanese restaurant.  However, the foie gras is also fantastic quality.  The sear adds only a slight crust to the exterior, the foie gras is left with that great umami flavor and mouth feel.  I absolutely would get this again and highly recommend you do the same.  The chilean seabass was cooked perfectly and served in a balsamic teriyaki sauce that was sweet & syrupy but not too heavy.  I could have just ordered a large filet of this fish and been very satisfied with my meal.  The crab fried rice is probably the best fried rice I have ever eaten.  It was served toward the end of the meal, which was new to me.  I devoured this stuff, I could have eaten another bowl, and this was after all of the food we had already eaten.  It had some nice heat, everything was prepared well, and the seasoning was spot on.  If you don't get this with your tasting menu, I would say it's well worth it for the table to add it ala carte.    The yellowtail tartare was another table favorite.  Served with caviar in a fantastic sauce (you get so much stuff it's hard to keep track and remember what everything was, so all I know about this sauce is I like it), it was tartare of the highest quality.  The surprising dish for me was the king crab tempura.  Light but with a great tempura crunch, this was a fantastic dish.  I liked everything, but a couple of the dishes had too much cilantro for my preference.  But, that was the only thing I could nitpick about in my entire meal at Nobu.  Finally, I cannot think of a meal more appropriate to act as my th review than the teppan table at Nobu.  I hope I am back very soon.",946,"['teppan', 'table', 'nobu', 'one', 'top', 'meals', 'life', 'pm', 'reservation', 'friday', 'night', 'th', 'time', 'buddy', 'reserved', 'teppan', 'table', 'previous',

pyqnGlIfP9Zw8LLxBjyAiA,"""Nobu""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"Thanks to Nobu, I can't truly enjoy Japanese cuisine in my hometown anymore. I've been ruined and awakened at the same time.  As advocated by our very knowledgeable and professional waiter, we had more of an experience than a meal. The usual inquires were made about our tastes and any allergies, then the rest was in the restaurant's hands. I'm glad they took the wheel, and they did not disappoint.  We were served several courses, each topping the next, and as time progressed my friends and I were looking at each other wondering when we were going to hit the finish line. Needless to say I was quite stuffed at the end and so was everyone else.  The highlights of the night were:  -The Yellowtail sashimi with jalapeño, with a nice salty, citrus, and spicy finish to it. I wish I had asked for a second plate of it. -Miso Cod: Dear Lord, I don't know how to explain it. If I ever get framed for murder and end up on death row, I'll chose this as my last meal. I can still taste that sweet and savory sauce with that flaked  fish meat. Even the skin of it was amazing. -Sushi Platter- Needs no explanation, the rice was at the perfect texture, the fish was oh-so fresh, and i didn't even need wasabi to add to it. I wanted to eat it in its pure form. Simply delightful.  The Mochi ice cream was a great finish, but I was too stuffed to try. My friends thoroughly enjoyed it though, and I trust their tastes. I finished my cocktail and had an espresso as a pick-me-up before starting my long night exploring the town.  Overall, I felt the food, service, and drinks were all on point. It was also moderately priced compared to the other restaurants we dined at, and given it's in Vegas, I don't expect anything to be cheap. We were content with our bill while being cognizant of the service and meal we received. I extremely look forward to eating here again when I return!",348,"['thanks', 'nobu', 'cant', 'truly', 'enjoy', 'japanese', 'cuisine', 'hometown', 'anymore', 'ive', 'ruined', 'awakened', 'time',

nM9NwHXy3EadihjJTG2i5w,"""Pancho's Vegan Tacos""",2.0,Las Vegas,NV,89121,"Updating"" as a reply for the owner.   Firstly: I never said nor stated I am strictly vegan. NOT being vegan however, doesn't diminish nor make my inquiries any less valid. My personal dietary restrictions don't take away my concerns for what is in your food that I am PAYING for and putting in my body. I'm flattered you dug through my other reviews though.   Secondly: How are you going to dispute ME on what YOUR employee SAID TO ME - To go and visit the taco shop around there. Because yes, he also is NOT vegan (like I told him I wasn't!)and eats at the taco shop when he doesn't want to eat where he works. Obviously you weren't there because if you were I would have received all this information on the spot. Which leads us to  My third point: I appreciate you giving us information about the food (now). The problem you STILL FAIL to realize AND address, is that NOWHERE on your website, or menus can we have the knowledge of (and verify) ingredients and the sources. You said it yourself!! All those other places are frozen , pre-made etc. So we're suppose to just now take your word on the basis that you ""exposed"" other establishments? That's what I meant when I said you have a responsibility as a VEGAN establishment to provide this information TRANSPARENTLY and have it READILY available to support your claim. It's nowhere to be found. If you don't understand what I am asking for with ""What are your ingredients for your all your vegan protein?"" I cant help you. That is as clear as I can make it. This IS about Panchos, not any other place.   Fourth: To be fair here. I read a couple of reviews BEFORE writing mine because I said to myself  ""Am I? Am I the only one who thinks this way?"" And no! I am not alone. Read some four star reviews, even five star reviews and you'll see where I get what I am saying in my review. Your customer base (not all) says your establishment is out of items constantly, the drink selection is minuscule to bare minimum and I got the ""hole in the wall"" reference from another two reviews. I was not the first one. So maybe even if reviews give you four or five stars, you should read them. Or don't. It's your business.   Lastly: This is very audacious of you.   ""Simply for the fact that we are % vegan, non-gmo and low sodium... your life just got healthier.""  Why cause  low sodium? Just because you believe that less sodium is good for you shows me how uninformed you personally really are. The scientific community has never come to consensus  that less sodium is best for everyone. Low sodium IS better when you've overloaded your system with it or if you have an intolerance to it. I am not in need of low sodium or non-gmo. I am in need of less calories. Which is what most of your dishes are NOT. Based on what I was served (NOT HOW MUCH I ATE) alone, it contained all my calories for one  hour period... a detriment to MY diet. Why would you think eating out at your establishment is making MY life healthier? How do you know I'm not having a cheat meal at your restaurant? Healthy = is a dish with protein equivalent to fats and carbs OR high volume (A LOT OF FOOD) but low fat\/low carb. Again, something the dishes served here aren't.   'When people say that Pancho's Vegan Tacos is a ""fast food"" place.. makes me wonder.'   Wonder no more. I just answered it for you.  If I ate here everyday I would become morbidly obese. It doesnt fit the healthy profile based on the proportions of carbs\/protein or volume\/carbs to MAINTAIN a healthy lifestyle. Personally, I maintain a strict diet so that I can eat out often. Unfortunately, I cant do that here.  I will check out your new location once it opens and the old one closes, maybe you'll have the nutrition facts and I will surely update my review then.",696,"['updating', 'reply', 'owner', 'firstly',

Sadly the parking on a Tuesday afternoon was rather challenging. It took me twenty minutes at the machine. Three cars ahead of me. I should've known, piling on took ten minutes. Luckily the attendant was on hand and she was helpful. Bonus, she remembered assisting me when I came in. The bar wouldn't go up and she even had issues with it releasing up so I could proceed into the garage. Yes, my plate was correctly on the parking meter ticket. Leaving it told me invalid ticket. That was after waiting twenty minutes on the line so I could leave.  Now, onto lunch (once I finally left the parking garage situation). Met some friends yesterday afternoon who were staying at Aria. It was about : on a Tuesday- not at all busy. Our waitress was far from that. My friend's husband inquired about the soup, and she spoke AT him and then as if he had no idea about soup or food. If personalities were sold, I would purchase one for her. She never returned inquiring if we needed anything additional. When she brought our drinks she basically threw them down.

The very decently sized (I'd call it a ""large"") Pepperoni Pizza was extremely oily and slightly too wet underneath, but was decent tasting.  The Meatballs were small and ridiculously overpriced for only getting three tiny ones and a few tiny plain crostini pieces that desperately needed a drizzle of olive oil.

It did have a lot of cheese on it, and was great when dipped in marinara.  Refills were provided when needed.  My mint chip shake was garnished with mint chocolate cookies (looked like thin mints) and was very tasty.  Service was pretty shaky.

It was fascinating to watch all of them work! This VERY nice to see and experience!....   Okay, we started with the Fanny Bay oysters (per. our server recommendation) and the crab cake!.. OH-OH-WOW!!!!!.... The oysters WHERE ON-MYY DELICIOUS!!!!... The watermelon mignonette with lemon and sauce.... WAS PERFECT!!... The crab cake.... Oh WOW.... The crab cake was just THAT!... All crab and less filling!. The remoulade sauce and greens were FANTASTIC additions!!!... Emeril's crab cake it probably second ONLY to the infamous Michael Jordan's crab cake here in Chicago!!.. I knew RIGHT THEN....the entre was going to just as GREAT; and IT DEFINITELY was. My wife got the special of the day which was a pasta dish. She LOVEDDDD it!!!!.. Pasta wasn't over cooked and the sauce was great!... The sun-dried tomatoes added just enough pop of flavor. I got the pecan crusted Texas Redfish!... Listen....... (read rather)... That was probably the BEST fish dish I have ever had in my ENTIRE adult life (THUS FAR)!!... It came with pepper jack grits, vegetable ratatouille and meuniere sauce......! I will leave it at that!. There were NO words as to how good this meal was... CRAZY SONS!!..... WOW! WOW!. WOW!... BAM!!!...  We finished off with Sorbet and pecan pie. The pie was RICH.... But not overbearing. You didn't have to drown yourself in water while eating it. The sorbet was a little much for even two people. The portion could be cut in half and be fine. Mixing both together was a nice clean eating to the overall meal. We both left not full, but VERY content!..

I'm surprised it took me this long to stay at the MGM Grand. I've always said I was going to, I made sure this time I did, and I'm very happy I did.  We stayed on the th floor. The room was excellent. Very spacious. I was very impressed with the amount of space in the room. From the pictures online, I didn't think it would be as much space as it was. I'm happy that it was. The bed was ultra comfortable, once you laid down, you didn't want to get back up! The views of outside were great, especially at night when all the other hotels on the strip are lit up.   The casino has tons or table games to partake in. I'm not much of a slot person, but if you enjoy those there's plenty here to play on. The sports book is one of the better looking ones I've been too. Tons of televisions for you to catch all the action.  The staff here was very good. It was a long line to check in, but that was expected with it being on a Friday and a big UFC match happening that next day, so it wasn't a big deal to me. The front desk staff was working hard to get everyone checked in quickly. The line move pretty quick based on the amount of people in line. We also had a problem with our iron in our room. We called the front desk and someone brought a new one up immediately. I was also greeted with a lot of hello and hi's from the staff when walking around the hotel.   The MGM Grand is a great hotel. I love the location of it, tons of cool and fun things in pretty close walking distance.

Oscar and Christie in particular helped me pull it off and it went even better than I anticipated thanks to their personal touches.

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,"""MGM Grand Hotel""",2.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"For a city where all things cost three times the amount of normal, you would think the hotels would give basic amenities. Want breakfast? That will be $-$ for some eggs, a McDonald's style hashbrown, and toast. A basic premade salad? $.. A drink? $-$. And that's just in the cheapest parts of the hotel.   Let's look at our room. First, when we got to registration, we waited in line half an hour only to be told that we were in the wrong place, they sent us to another part of the hotel. We lugged all our luggage and the baby, across the hotel. They tell us we need to go back to normal registration... So we lug it all back where we get to stand in line again, this time for  minutes. We finally get back to the desk where we find the last attendant had deleted our registration. Since we had booked this trip through a booking agent, the money we paid was not refunded, and we were without a place to sleep. We pulled out an emergency credit card and bought a room. Meanwhile, the baby is hungry and crying, and everything we had booked for that day is one by one being canceled. We get to our room only to be hit with the overwhelming smell of mildew and the sight of other peoples hair in the bed sheets. The baby starts coughing and soon we all are.   We call our booking agent and find that they did everything they were supposed to and it was the hotel that had messed up. So we spend the next two hours on the phone trying to not only get our money back but get a new room as well. We have to stay the night in the room. We move the offending sheets to a corner of the room and try to put the crib in the least smelling part of the tiny room. But the baby coughed and cried all night anyway. They moved us to a new, slightly bigger room the next day.   I was impressed with the size of the shampoo and conditioner bottles until it took the entire bottle to cover my relatively short hair. The pool was the best part of the hotel, by far. With a bunch of different pools and a lazy river, it was nice. Their times have a lot to answer for, however. They open late in the morning and close early in the evening. In a city that never sleeps, you would think they would keep it open. But it's the one place they don't nickel and dime you, so maybe not. By the way, they no longer let you rent tubes, you have to buy them.",460,"['city', 'things', 'cost', 'three', 'times', 'amount', 'normal', 'would', 'think', 'hotels', 'would', 'give', 'basic',

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,"""MGM Grand Hotel""",3.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"This casino is huge, probably nd next to Caesars Palace.  I stayed here after receiving a comp room through MyVEGAS which included a west wing room.  Check-in was a breeze as I did the mobile check-in.  Tip: check-in online through the email they send you; it allows you to skip past waiting in the general line!  The room was pretty small but had a comfy king size bed.  I thought the room design was outdated and no irrational.  The bathroom was open, literally a glass door that encloses the toilet and the shower. There isn't a fan at all which allowed for mold to grow in the shower! The room itself is pretty dim, only one window above the bed which got no direct sunlight whatsoever.  Also I kept waking up in the night from what I thought was vibrations of slamming doors of the showers in the hotel...turned out there was construction happening next door!  My recommendation is upgrade to the next room up! My friends upgraded to the two queen beds (at additional cost) and it was spacious and the bathroom at least is enclosed for privacy!   I really don't understand why the fitness room is located all the way across the casino.  I understand the marketing strategy but from the point of the view of the guest, it's convenient for them to have it located in the same hotel tower. Although, the fitness center is larger than some I've been to on the strip and has a nice view overlooking the pool!   I've been to Vegas almost every year since I was little and parking was always free! As of late, MGM and its partnering casinos (Mirage, MonteCarlo, Luxor,etc) charge parking per hour. If you are a guest, there is a fee of $ per day and you are allowed to park at any of the participating casinos without extra charge. We definitely took advantage of this and parked at Mirage and walked over to Venetian for dinner and dessert or Caesars for shopping!  I wouldn't stay here again, once enough was a good experience but I did enjoy the variety of slots and table games they had!",361,"['casino', 'huge', 'probably', 'nd', 'next', 'caesars', 'palace',

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,"""MGM Grand Hotel""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"Worst experience at this hotel. Staff is friendly enough, but incompetent. After I checked in on Friday, I informed bell desk how good their dry cleaning service is because I have a very expensive sweater and I don't trust many places cleaning it.  The staff informed me it will be in good hands and great care will be taken care of it. After mailing it over for about - minutes, I decide to go ahead and trust these guys with my item. (Surely a hotel of this stature is on top of things like this).   The employees give me a confusing piece of paper to fill out, and after  hours of traveling to get to Vegas I wasn't thinking clearly and checked off my sweater under ""laundry"".   I get my sweater back two days later, and find out it is two sizes too small and fuzzy. My $ sweater is now unwearable.   I confront the bell desk, and the manager informs me that they do not know what happened because the MGM does not dry clean their clothes, they send everything to a separate company to handle it. (Never was explained this before).   I explained to manager how my sweater was clearly not dry cleaned but washed in a harsh cycle and it is ruined. Upon further inspection of my receipt, the manager points out that I had checked my sweater off under ""laundry"" tab. I explain to manager that their paperwork is BS and I specially asked for dry cleaning not laundry and how did their  employees assisting me not catch my mistake or volunteer to fill out the form. The answer was, ""well I'm sorry about that, would you like me to send it to out to get it washed again and maybe stretched""   Thank you MGM for costing me $ and not being transparent.

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,"""MGM Grand Hotel""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"Stayed here for conference with my husband \/\/ to \/\/ (actually, I'm still in this god forsaken  hellhole writing this review with no escape due to the hour of the night and the fact that the room is prepaid) and I can't wait to leave.   Upon check in after a long flight from NY, I waited in line to check in for ONE HOUR to check in. As I tried to find my room, I was tripping over children (yes, children sleeping in the floor and sitting at slots in the casino), and that was an experience. All of the elevators to get to your room are in the middle, that's right, the middle, of the casino.    Upon entering the elevator (which anyone from the street can access as there is no security or any measures to keep people outside of the hotel from wandering around to your door), I was greeted with a stink of garbage, marijuana and old spilled beer--ugh.   Upon entering my room, it appeared near, UNTIL I noticed something on the portrait in my room---a SEMEN STAIN from God known when.  I called The desk, who sent me to the concierge, who did nothing. That was Sunday.   Monday, stain still there even though cleaning person was in room (the who hotel is filthy, so who knows what's going on), so again, why she didn't see it, I don't  know. Inwas told by Hotel Manager  that it would be taken care of.  It wasn't.  Tuesday morning:!went to concierge who directed, and personally walked my husband and I to her.  She didn't believe us (we had photos, unfortunately) and suggested that maybe someone was paining a mounding and it dropped on the paining.  Umm, no!  She refused to take any responsibility or to make it right and said it would be taken care of immediately.  Since the room hadn't been clean yet, I figured ""okay"".  Nothing was done seven hours later.   Tuesday afternoon, my husband went to complain (after I was left on hold for  minutes waiting to speak to a manager) and was told it would be taken care of.   Tuesday evening: we return from a great night and find that the stain is now smeared on the painting, but there's  extra towels in the bathroom.  WHAT????  I decided to go down to the front desk at : (less than an hour ago) and clear this up.  I was told by WOODY (how apropos to my situation) that he will send someone up to clean it right then (at : pm, no!). I told him of how I spent a lot money in his hotel and could have stayed somewhere else better for less: example the ""Delano""). I told him how grossed out I was and he shrugged and said he and his girlfriend where in the same position last month and they were ""powerless"" too.  First of all: I don't care; secondly: then do better than what you had.    It left off with him saying his hotel is too large to help everyone and that he has no control over house keeping.   I suggest that Woody read the want ads to find a job where he can pass the buck and be proud of the anarchy and jungle he is helping to build.  (Hey, he may be good for the DNC---kidding, sort of).   Anyway, the real gem was his last statement to me "" You're leaving tomorrow anyway, so what difference does it make if you stay in the room one more?"". I'm sure Hooters and Motel  accords the street are cleaner and run better.   Stay away! I wish Yelp didn't make me give a star, this place is in the negatives.",620,"['stayed', 'conference', 'husband', 'actually', 'im', 'still', 'god', 'forsaken', 'hellhole', 'writing', 'review',

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,"""MGM Grand Hotel""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"I'll admit to never writing reviews on Yelp. It's been just about one week since we've been back from Las Vegas, and I'm still bothered by our experience at MGM. Thankfully we only had one night there. Admittidly we booked the room to be able to use the lazy river. I wish I had known we'd be paying $ for one drink at the bar outside.   First, check-in was extremely long. Their mobile check in was 'down' so everyone had to wait in line. It was only pm, but the line wrapped back and forth a few times. When we got to the desk, there was a hard sell on an upgrade. We ended up doing it when we were told it was 'a nicer tower with a much better view, especially of the pool'. That was a total lie. We had a low floor view of the building. The rooms, and elevators, were all extremely dark.  We spent what was left of the day at the pool, and then the casino at night. We got to our room at about midnight, and went to bed. We were awoken at :am by an extremely loud crash into our door. Being woken out of a dead sleep by what sounded like someone breaking into the room was not pleasant. My boyfriend looked out the peephole to see what was going on, only to see a hooker and a John fighting in the hallway. While I understand you can't control how guests act, it was how security acted that really upset me. I called security and we waited in our room for them to arrive while listening to the screaming and fighting. My boyfriend met the security guards in the hallway, and pointed them to the room a few doors down where the guy was. The woman came back at him, still screaming, while security looked on. They allowed them to continue to yell and stomp down the hallway and throw items. A few times my boyfriend asked the guard that was by our door if he could please remove them from our floor because I was still visibly bothered by the fighting, as I was trying to come down from the adrenaline rush from being woken up. Instead of separating the hooker and the John to sort out the issue, he told my boyfriend to be quiet as if he were the problem. When they eventually calmed down after about  minutes, security walked the female away, and the man went back to his room. When we left in the morning, they were taking off his bloodied hotel room door as he watched on.  We waited in the long check-out line to bring up the issue. They basically said 'sorry' and took off the resort fee. $ compensation for a horrendous nights sleep. They took no responsibility for being unable or unwilling to take control of a bad situation and make their guests feel safe. We were also assured that he was removed from the property, which was a lie, seeing as we saw him twice that next morning. Once outside his room, and once in the lobby.    I will never again stay at MGM.",534,"['ill', 'admit', 'never', 'writing', 'reviews', 'yelp', 'one', 'week', 'since', 'weve', 'back', 'las', 'vegas', 'im', 'still', 'bothered', 'experience', 'mgm',

I had to call the hotel  times to get a copy of a receipt.   I spoke with a woman in guest services who argued with me about a charge and told me I disputed it because she didn't see it. I asked very nicely to speak to her manager and she said no. She kept arguing with me and then said she would transfer me to accounts payable ... because I'm a vendor? What on earth?! I called back and asked that she not speak to me so rudely and that I just wanted to speak with a manager, she argued some more and hung up on me. Quite honestly, I'm appalled at how I was treated. I don't think I was asking for anything out of the ordinary. In fact, when I called in the day before, the representative saw the charge I was looking for and said she sent a receipt - I didn't receive it though. The run around and chaos that is MGM Grand Las Vegas is atrocious. I would never again voluntarily give my money to this place. Unfortunately their portfolio houses many of the hotels in Vegas (and other places) but from my recent experiences, they're all going south. There's no excuse to treat customers this way.

El4FC8jcawUVgw_0EIcbaQ,"""MGM Grand Hotel""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"Tldr: if you want to be treated like a human, don't come to this casino; so many better places that will treat you kindly   This review is just of the casino's staff treatment:  I was walking through the casino with my parents to get back to their sister property, the Signature. My parents stopped by one of the machines and my mom wanted to show me something. One of the employees stopped me and this I didn't mind because ,granted, I do look young for my age and do look underage compared to others. But his attitude and the way he handled the situation appalled me. He was incredibly rude towards me and was basically accusing me of underage gambling even though we were just standing by one of the machines. He didn't even ask me for ID at first. He just kept questioning me about my age and when he finally asked for my ID, he didn't do so very nicely. When he finally verified my age by slowly calculating the difference between  and my birth year, he just looked angry (probably because he was so excited to try and kick someone out of the casino). All he could say was ""Oh....you look really young..."" and then tried to leave hurriedly and threw a quick and angry ""sorry about that"" before running off quickly.  Look, I get it... minors try to gamble all the time and you're just trying to do your job. But you're in the customer services industry, at least try to be friendly. I was in Vegas for two full days and I was carded at multiple other establishments, but none of the other casinos handled the situation as poorly as MGM Grand. Rather, at other casinos, I actually struck up a friendly and fun conversation with the attendants who carded me and had a lovely time speaking with them. Honestly speaking, you should learn from your sister properties.

We didn't have reservations, the place was packed on a Monday, but they were able to sit us at a bistro table in the bar area. Now, this was the first table by the host stand, which typically would make for a not so great dining experience. But from start to finish we had great service, amazing food and we have zero complaints.   We were greeted immediately and before we could even ask for vegan options we were presented with an entire vegan and vegetarian menu. You read that right, each table is presented with an epic separate veggie menu, no ""let me ask the chef"" with an eye roll or ""maybe a salad with no dressing"" after asking. We were in heaven.   We started with the shishito peppers and crispy ginger gyoza. Then split the vegan spicy veggie roll and the impossible burger sliders. Finished with a vegan cookie dough cake pop. Shared a bottle of yummy bubbly. Holy. Crap.   Now, the impossible burgers definitely lived up to the hype- we could have devoured about  of them. Surprisingly, the most delicious thing we ate was the vegan spicy roll! It had been so long since we had a veggie sushi roll that had actual flavor and different textures that we about passed out from pure happiness.   So the moral of this story. If you are a vegan in Vegas, and you want a more upscale dining experience that doesn't involve manipulating a menu or asking the chef to make something up then Andrea's is highly recommended.",315,"['vegan', 'las', 'vegas', 'isnt', 'always', 'easy', 'strip', 'especially', 'want', 'veggie', 'burger', 'boring', 'salad', 'excited', 'find', 'andreas', 'stumbled', 'upon', 'menu',

Since that day I have come in everyday with out fail and completed  punch cards that they give you which gives you a free drink after  purchases. They have always been super welcoming from the start but in the short time I have been coming here they now all know me by name and all say hello as soon as I walk in the door. Today they even made my order before I even got to the register so it was ready for me as soon as I paid. Seriously top quality staff, beverages, and atmosphere. On a Friday or Saturday night this place is filled with hip young people all making connections and enjoying the ambiance. It would be a mistake to not give this place a shot because I guarantee if you do you will be coming back every day!!! Best tea spot in Vegas!!

This was the first shop that popped up on the list of suggested places to go to. We figured it had plenty of  stars and plenty of reviews. I mean come on, as my friend stated, ""Not a lot of boba places have a  star rating"".  So we decided to go.   This is a small shop. We were lucky that we missed the loooong line that followed us after we ordered. I ordered my usual - iced Thai tea with pudding. Generally the pudding is too hard in most boba spots but this one was soft and pretty tasty, not too sweet. The Thai tea itself was also not too sweet. I really liked it. The boyfriend ordered the passion fruit slushie and he really liked it. I wish I had the chance to taste it but I was really enjoying my Thai tea drink.  Oh and the prepped the drinks pretty fast so you're not waiting around for awhile.   The only thing about this place that my friends and I weren't too keen about was the cashier. She didn't offer us the frequent buyer stamp card.  She also stamped the one card that we shared only  times even though we ordered  drinks. When we inquired why she did that she gave some statement about it's not in their policy and then she said something else but we couldn't hear it. Our friend even told her that she lived there and that it's her card but the cashier didn't want to hear it. She wasn't mean or rude about it, it was just a really weird situation.

When I called to reserve the room I spoke with Tiffany Easton, the Group Sales Manager, who was wonderful to deal with.  I contacted her about  months before the dinner by phone (I live in NY) and she couldn't have been more helpful.  If she wasn't available when I called she always quick in getting back to me.  There was an extensive menu to choose from (much more than the  menu in the regular part of the restaurant)  and the food was very good (we had several appetizers, pastas and entrees and everything was good except the shrimp scampi was too chewy) .

I always order the vegetable pho with vegetable broth which comes with broccoli, bok choy and carrots. They have a fried tofu appetizer that is what some could call ""tofu done right"" and it is amazing! I usually tolerate tofu but whatever way they fry this one, makes it taste divine! Comes with a delicious soy dipping sauce. The staff are nice and friendly.

You'll definitely find foods that are very unique compared to other usual fare. Every item I have tried is delicious and seasoned well. They even have a secret spice blend to put in your olive oil for bread dipping.  The place is small inside with half being dining and half is a marketplace. But it's a pleasant ambience.  The service was super friendly and the servers are happy to answer any questions about the menu. They are always perfectly attentive and the kitchen serves up food fresh and quickly.   I highly recommend this place especially if you're looking for something a little different to try eating!,164,"['first', 'came', 'business', 'colleagues', 'quick', 'bite', 'eat', 'cant', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'things', 'place', 'food', 'consists', 'bulgarian', 'russian', 'inspired', 'dishes', 'portions', 'average', 'size', 'id', 'suggest', 'ordering', 'things', 'share', 'party', 'recommend', 'bacon', 'wrapped', 'dates', 'grape', 'leaves', 'youll', 'definitely', 'find', 'foods', 'unique', 'compared', 'usual', 'fare', 'every', 'item', 'tried', 'delicious', 'seasoned', 'well', 'even', 'secret', 'spice', 'blend', 'put', 'olive', 'oil', 'bread', 'dipping', 'place', 'small', 'inside', 'half', 'dining', 'half', 'marketplace', 'pleasant', 'ambience', 'service', 'super', 'friendly', 'servers', 'happy', 'answer', 'questions', 'menu', 'always', 'perfectly', 'attentive', 'kitchen', 'serves', 'food', 'fresh', 'quickly', 'highly', 'recommend', 'place', 'especially', 'youre', 'looking', 'something', 'little', 'different', 'try', 'eating']", first came business colleagues quick bite eat cant say enough good things place food consists bulgarian russian inspired dishes portions average size id suggest ordering things share party recommend bacon wrapped dates grape leaves youll definitely find foods unique compared usual fare every item tried delicious seasoned well even secret spice blend put olive oil bread dipping place small inside half dining half marketplace pleasant ambience service super friendly servers happy answer questions menu always perfectly attentive kitchen serves food fresh quickly highly recommend place especially youre looking something little different try eating,73,0.4451219512195122,first came business colleague quick bite eat cant say enough good thing place food consists bulgarian russian inspired dish portion average size id suggest ordering thing share party recommend bacon wrapped date grape leaf youll definitely find food unique compared usual fare every item tried delicious seasoned well even secret spice blend put olive oil bread dipping place small inside half dining half marketplace pleasant ambience service super friendly server happy answer question menu always perfectly attentive kitchen serf food fresh quickly highly recommend place especially youre looking something little different try eating,first came busi colleagu quick bite eat cant say enough good thing place food consist bulgarian russian inspir dish portion averag size id suggest order thing share parti recommend bacon wrap date grape leaf youll definit find food uniqu compar usual fare everi item tri delici season well even secret spice blend put oliv oil bread dip place small insid half dine half marketplac pleasant ambienc servic super friend server happi answer question menu alway perfect attent kitchen serf food fresh quick high recommend place especi your look someth littl differ tri eat,"['first', 'came', 'busi', 'colleagu', 'quick', 'bite', 'eat', 'cant', 'say', 'enough', 'good', 'thing', 'place', 'food', 'consist', 'bulgarian', 'russian', 'inspir', 'dish', 'portion', 'averag', 'size', 'id', 'suggest', 'order', 'thing', 'share', 'parti', 'recommend', 'bacon', 'wrap', 'date', 'grape', 'leaf', 'youll', 'definit', 'find', 'food', 'uniqu', 'compar', 'usual', 'fare', 'everi', 'item', 'tri', 'delici', 'season', 'well', 'even', 'secret', 'spice', 'blend', 'put', 'oliv', 'oil', 'bread', 'dip', 'place', 'small', 'insid', 'half', 'dine', 'half', 'marketplac', 'pleasant', 'ambienc', 'servic', 'super', 'friend', 'server', 'happi', 'answer', 'question', 'menu', 'alway', 'perfect', 'attent', 'kitchen', 'serf', 'food', 'fresh', 'quick', 'high', 'recommend', 'place', 'especi', 'your', 'look', 'someth', 'littl', 'differ', 'tri', 'eat']",0.17756666666666668,18,0.1978021978021978,93

0q_BHpxbikVtPRRLRu-U0g,"""Picasso""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"Perhaps I waited too long to come here because the food seemed too classical and not daring. Granted, chef Julian Serrano's award-winning restaurant is nearly -years-old and I did try to visit in , but was told the restaurant was closed for a private event. Not that the food was bad or dated, but it took time for me to adjust to the traditional French refinement instead of bold creativity. When sitting down to eat at Picasso, think ""attention to detail"" to get into the right mindset and ask after every bite, ""Can I taste the essence of each ingredient?""  The cooking is not about big flavors, but subtle clarity and detailed execution. I imagine that the kitchen is filled with immersion circulators to cook the food to the exact degree. Vegetables like innocent little carrots that were precisely between crunchy and soft or beets just tender enough to cut through, but not more.  The flavor profiles were not about unique or clever ingredient mash-ups, but traditional combinations like foie gras with apple or veal with potato. Even when straying from French into German cuisine, the deer loin was served with a tangy red cabbage slaw.  This is not fatty French cooking where butter and cream are the main ingredients. Fats coat the palate which block the ability to taste the spirit of each ingredient. The asparagus and morels came with a cream sauce, but it was very thin instead of heavy which allowed the vegetables and mushrooms to shine. The spring pea soup was more like a pea broth than a thick veloute - again to let the pea flavor become the center of attention. Even the dressing on the warm quail salad was fantastically light instead of heavy with oil.  Instead of dislocating a shoulder while hoisting the enormous wine book, I opted for one of the two convenient wine pairings (the cheaper $ version) for the three savory courses. The pairing was a journey around the world with great explanations by the sommelier. The conservative pairings were consistently light compared to the food. The approach is the wine should be subordinate to the food. Boldness was neither for the food nor the wine.  Although the waiter was flippantly confident that our :P reservation would allow plenty of time for a :P curtain of ""O"", he was wrong. We arrived at the show on time, but had to rush through the petit fours and hustle through the casino.  The dining room was decorated with not just one Picasso painting, but many works using different mediums. Probably not a seat in the house that didn't have at least two Picassos in view. The one wall without artwork was the glass doors with a view of the dancing Bellagio fountains.  The attire is dressy with jacket preferred, but good luck enforcing that in Las Vegas. It's too bad. There are only a few times when playing ""dress up"" is encouraged - prom, red carpet events, and Vegas. Seize the opportunity instead of being too (casually) cool for school.  The restaurant is located downstairs from where the shopping area and the casino connect. Jean-Georges Vongerichten's Prime Steakhouse is next door. The simplest menu selection was four-courses for $ with three to six different selections per course.  On my next visit to Vegas, I hope to slip into the bar for barrel-aged cocktails while gazing, not into my girlfriend's eyes, but at the large Picasso painting.

Since I live in NYC, I have tried many  and -star Michelin restaurants including some in Europe so I know what to expect of the food and service.   We did the five course set menu and honestly I thought the bread and Amuse-bouche was the best part of the meal. I ordered the lamb and it was just fine however my mom ordered the halibut and it was so dry that she ate only one bite. The servers didn't ask how it was and just took our plates and moved onto the next course. As a courtesy, we felt that it wasn't right to automatically say what we thought of the food so we just left it. Strike #. After dessert, we were so full that we couldn't eat the petit fours that they gave us, so we asked if they could box it up and we could take it home.

Conveniently located for an after-biking-and-on-my-way-home breakfast. On Rainbow just south of Cactus.   I waited to write a review because I wanted to try the chicken fried steak for myself. I love crispy, and this batter was one of the best! I chose over easy egg, potatoes and pancakes instead of the hash browns and biscuit. I like that the gravy was not too rich or heavy. The first time I came here, I had the breakfast sandwich with hash browns and it was ok but didn't rock my world - same for the coffee. From my picture, it looks like the hash browns are burnt, but they didn't taste burnt.  But what stands out to me are the people who work there. The first time, we chatted with the owner a bit who was quite personable. This second time, one of our servers was so chatty and made us laugh with his storytelling skills!

My hubby and I were excited that a new Chinese establishment had just opened nearby and have been eager to try it out  We went in around  pm on a Monday. It was completely empty, not one table was filled. We were quickly seated and given the menus. Without really explaining anything on the menu or giving us much time to look over the menu, the server who barely knew any English seemed to rush us to order our food. We ordered pork & cabbage steamed dumplings as an appetizer, and  noodle dishes as our main.   We were surprised to see that the noodle dishes came as quickly as they did, before the appetizer. Thinking it can happen maybe due to the dumplings being handmade to order, we waited for them. And waited. And waited some more.   We waited more than  minutes after our noodle dishes were brought out, we were nearly close to finishing our main noodle dishes. The server brought us what we thought were the dumplings we ordered, only to see that they were potstickers. Either the server put in the wrong order or the cook messed it up. She apologized and took it back to where the owner and her friend was sitting. They end up eating the potstickers, while we waited for the cook to make our dumplings that we waited more than  minutes for. By this time, we were all done with the main dishes. We waited. And waited. And waited some more.   We waited another  minutes before getting impatient. I flagged down the server and asked where our dumplings were. She said that the cook forgot about our order and that we would have to wait  more minutes for them. What the fuck??   They had ONE table, ONE order, ONE job, and they fucked it up. Even now I'm boiling up trying to relive our horrible experience. I can understand things like this can happen have they been busy, but we were the ONLY ones in the restaurant besides the owner, her friend, the server, and the cook.   What made it even worse was that there were no apologies, no nothing. The owner showed no empathy whatsoever. What she did do was bring her food out to the table right behind us so they can eat their lunch. Are you fucking serious?  Walking out of that restaurant was the most awkward situation I have ever encountered. There was no bye, no thank you, no sorry, no nothing. It was all silence.   Again, we were the ONLY customers in the restaurant, they messed up on the most simple order, and the owner doesn't have the decency to come and apologize? For a restaurant that has only been open for a month, I'm not sure what makes her think she has any potential for success.

rTS8LsUmNIiXsXydE49tPA,"""Margaritaville""",2.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"We came here for lunch as a family with young kids the other day based on the recommendation of some friends that this is a fun place for the children. Seemed a little odd to me, but hey, why not?  Parking is available via the Flamingo Hotel and Vegas locals can still park for free for  hours. Yay!  It's a bit of a walk to the restaurant, through the casino from the parking garage to Margaritaville.   We were able to be seated pretty quickly since the restaurant wasn't too busy for the lunch service. Our server was Susanna. She came by and plopped some menus on the table. Literally, a few minutes later, she came back and asked if we had drink orders ready. Since we barely had time to pick up the menu to look at it, we asked that she come back in a few. She walked away for one minute and then came right back. So we rushed to give her some drink orders.   As we sat there trying to check out the kids menu and the regular menu, she appears again. This time she seemed rush to take our food order. If you have young kids, you know it requires a bit of patience to get everyone situated. Most of the party had decided on what to eat, but my young daughter still hadn't. So we started giving her the orders. Susanna seemed like we were wasting her time because she had to pause for  seconds while my daughter finally came to a decision. I'm not really sure why there was such a rush when the whole place wasn't that busy. But we were made to feel like we were inconveniencing her. Needless to say, our service experience was pretty crappy. Even after having a chat with the manager, not much changed.  There is not separate menu for lunch, which means the prices amount to the high Strip prices for dinner. At least there is a kids menu. An entree will run you from $-.   The food really wasn't that fabulous for the prices. Pretty average. We had the crab\/artichoke dip which was tasty. Fish and chips were average. Jr. Cheeseburger pretty large for a kid. Crab cakes tasted like they were frozen and pretty mushy.   If anything, you're paying for the atmosphere of this place. It looked like there was a large stage in the dining area for live music, which was not utilized during the lunch service. The music is playing so loud inside the restaurant that it's hard to have a conversation with anyone at your table.   So if you're looking for a place to drink cocktails and party, this might be a better fit. If you're looking for a good meal, this probably isn't the place, at least based on our experience.",472,"['came', 'lunch', 'family', 'young', 'kids', 'day', 'based', 'recommendation', 'friends',

First off, i walked in and stood there for a couple minutes and not one person approached me, welcomed me, acknowledged that i was there, nor asked if I have been helped. So i was just standing there staring at the menus, and mind you i work at the hospital as a nurse so i came in and expect to get right out for a quick lunch break, but still nothing, and it wasnt at all busy. So i approached the bar and finally made eye-contact with the bartender and said i was there for pick up.  I received the bill $ something. i paid with $ and said just to keep the change. All she said was ""do you atleast want the receipt?"" No thank you or nothing. Im driving and actually took a look at the bill and this is what really burst my bubble. They charged % gratuity ! ... for a Chicken Sandwhich! For a bill of ONE PERSON! FOR AN ORDER FOR PICK UP!

While my friends knew it existed and they've had it, we decided to brave the long line and grab a few slices.  It was past midnight on a Saturday night and the line wasn't getting shorter as we stood in it. People were passing by us with either slices of pizza or a full on box with a whole pie in it.   When you get to the front of the line, you kinda ignore the menu that they have and just point out the ones that you like. Come to think of it, I think their menu just states the prices and some options but that's all I could remember. In any case, you choose from a handful of choices then they heat it up for you. Each slice is about $-$. A little steep for a New York slice but I get it since there was an ample amount of toppings on it. I opted for the pepperoni & sausage and a slice of just sausage. I had the sausage that night and it was goooood. They have red pepper flakes and parmesan cheese if you choose to top your slice with it. Without it was still pretty delicious.

The crepe was a nice soft texture and the fruits provided a nice tart flavor. I liked the sweet creamy coconut sorbet most.   CHOCOLATE COVERED STRAWBERRIES The strawberries weren't sweet, but sour and the chocolate was really sweet. The white chocolate was too sweet for my liking and the dark chocolate would've tasted better with the strawberry if the strawberry wasn't too sour.

EUWBT5GDxPC95w9itZ1EHw,"""Garden Court Buffet""",3.0,Las Vegas,NV,89101,"Great buffet for the price - downtown Las Vegas!  I dislike buffets and what I dislike more is paying for parking to dine at the establishment. Many of the casinos now require parking in their garage at the Strip or parking lot at the Fremont Street Experience so in order to get free parking we needed to dine in one of the casino restaurants to get our parking ticket validated. This buffet is located inside the Main Street Station Casino Brewery Hotel at the Fremont Street Experience. Actually, this buffet wasn't too bad. We arrived almost closing time at :p but the buffet is open for another  minutes after they closed at :p.   Saturday was Prime Rib & Scampi Special. I'm not certain and can't remember how much we paid. The prime rib from the carving station was tender, tasty and delicious. The food was your typical buffet menu but this one had Hawaiian fare including pork kālua plus more at the very end and I saw it only after I got full from my first serving. I also had menudo. Yum! All the food I had was fresh and well heated. Dinner and parking validation... we'll take it!  The dining area is in an airy room with Victorian decor. Our server was nice and friendly and always readily refilling our drinks and clearing our used plates from our table. There were not that many diners at this hour nearing closing time so she was attentive to our table. I'm still not fond of buffets but this experience at the Fremont Street Experience was alright. A gem in downtown Vegas. With our validated parking we walked to Fremont Street Experience right after for some music entertainment from the live cover bands...

YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"""Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca""",2.0,Las Vegas,NV,89052,"Really disappointed in my dinner at Bottiglia.  I think my expectations may have been a little unrealistic given the number of positive reviews, but this place just did not land for me.  Our party of three arrived around : on a Sunday and were seated immediately.  The space is nice, but there were TVs in virtually every section.  While I like to watch games as much as the next guy while I am eating, the TVs did not match the decor.  Service was okay at the beginning of the meal, then got progressively worse throughout the evening.  We were immediately served the gratis bread basket and our drinks.  Of the bread, the only one that was semi-memorable were the crisps with baked on cheese.  The remaining bread was average at best, but it was good at sopping up the sauce of the arancini.  This was a strong appetizer, probably the best dish of the evening.  Very cheesy and the sauce was seasoned well.  We did not let any of this dish go to waste.  The calamari was our second appetizer, and this one did not go as well.  To begin, it was either not fried at a hot enough temperature or was left in the grease too long.  The vast majority of the pieces were not crispy, some were downright soggy.  Additionally, the breading did not adher well to the pieces.  The red sauce served on the side was fine, and the cream-based sauce was very good.  But, the calamari was a miss completely.  It took an excessive amount of time for us to receive our entrees.  So much time the server apologized, which was appreciated.    To eat, I went with the Caesar salad and the braised short rib.  That dish is served with ricotta spinach dumplings.  The short rib was good, but not nearly as tender as I expected given that this dish was braised.  I did not finish the entree.  I did, however, finish all of the dumplings.  These were pillowy soft and cheesy but had a very slight crust to them.  Very good, I should have ordered more on the side.  One in our party had the veal ravioli.  It came with  regular-sized ravioli for $.  I am sure it was good, but that is too small for an appetizer.  I also know that the majority of Italian places have designed their menus so you order both a pasta and a main course.  So, I am not expecting a mountain of pasta in any dish.  But, when he only ordered the ravioli the server should have warned him how small the dish was.    Finally, to cap off the evening, we waited more than a half hour before we received our check and were able to leave.  We just sat there with empty plates (or, more accurately, plates that were clearly finished because our silverware and\/or napkins had been placed on the remaining food) for way too long.    Perhaps we went on an off night, that can certainly happen.  Or, maybe I just don't get it given the number of Yelpers that really liked this joint.  But, this place simply did not land for me.  Also, I much preferred its predecessor, Terra Verde.  On future trips to Green Valley Ranch I do not think I will be returning.",551,"['really', 'disappointed', 'dinner', 'bottiglia', 'think', 'expectations', 'may', 'little', 'unrealistic', 'given',

YILyHegzhy1vlc_LNVfObw,"""Bottiglia Cucina & Enoteca""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89052,Love this place for Sunday brunch. Gave  stars because our service was very slow in receiving our food but still very courteous. Our waitress did apologize. There was a big bridal shower that reserved the entire outdoor patio.   Went here with my sis for brunch. Been here before when I had my bachelorette brunch with my girls. The restaurant looks like something out of Pinterest with a shabby chic vibe that is bright and inviting. They also have outdoor dining for dining al fresco. Btw mostly women were dining here.

My cousin suggested to check out this place, after hearing about their November half off pasta deal, and I am so glad she made us the reservation.   Came here on a Tuesday, which was a double deal since they're oysters were only a dollar(which is every Tuesday btw). AND LET ME TELL YOU, one of the best oysters I've ever had! It didn't even need the extra sauces it came with on the side. Our group ordered a total of , and if we didn't have more food coming, I would've devoured another  all to myself! We also had the calamari, which was a little too salty, but I liked the crunchiness to the breading! And they also give you a platter of bread while you wait for your food, which i didn't care too much for since we had other, greater options, but I will say their butter is good! Very light and slightly melted, and a lemony taste.   I had the king crab pasta and my boyfriend had the short rib with spaghetti pasta.  And yet another ""let me tell you moment"".. LET ME TELL YOU, their pasta is AMAZING - more especially the king crab one! Probably the best pasta I've had. Had the perfect texture, the perfect flavor (a light lemon flavor - which wasn't overpowering at all, and the perfect amount crab! The short rib was inferior out of the two, but still delicious. The short rib was very tender, and the pasta was cooked perfectly al dente, but I didn't like the sauce all too much, which was tomato based.   Service was good! Our waters were constantly filled, our server was friendly, the hostesses were friendly and took great photos of us when asked!  The only thing that knocked off a star was the wait?  We were sat about  minutes after our reservation time, which isn't long but I promise you, it makes the wait worth it if you just be a little honest with not having the table ready on time.  I will definitely come back for their oysters! Oh!

We went for lunch on a weekday about : so it was not the lunch rush. Three of us got the lunch specials and I got a salad. We got the small soup bowl--nice touch--but then waited  minutes before my salad came out and then we kept waiting for the rest of our party's food. We waited  minutes more and I finally got up from the table and tracked down the waiter to ask him about the  other meals. He looked at our table and ran to the kitchen. About  minutes later he brought out three more meals. Total . hours to get the food! Ridiculous. The table next to us was having the same problem getting their food. Was it good? It was as good as any good Thai restaurant. But no way is it worth the poor service.

cyzOijFJ82cae6qH6L8vuw,"""Arawan Thai Bistro and Dessert""",2.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"Yes, they have a high review rating on Yelp. Yes, their food is good and presentation of dishes and overall atmosphere are more on the fancy side. Yes, this place will probably always be busy with customers and continue to receive accolades. However, my one experience at this place, which was over a four-person dinner reservation on a summer Friday evening while I was in town for the weekend, was less positive than expected. Let me explain why.   First of all, our server was rude. Not in an overt way, but rather in the manner of her being too overbearing and inconsiderate. After showing us to our table, she began explaining the menu before we all had a chance to sit down, and she even blocked my one friend from getting to her seat, so my friend ended up just going to the bathroom first. On top of that, the server then prematurely came back to take our drink\/appetizer order before my friend had returned to the table and sat down--meaning, she hadn't even had a chance to look at the menu yet! To me, this constitutes as rude practice, and that right there had set the negative tone for me. After that, the same server, on several occasions, kept reaching over me and did not allow appropriate space between herself and our table. Also, why do servers\/wait staff always want to take our plates away before we are thoroughly done with each dish??!!? On multiple occasions, our server, as well as another wait staff, had tried to reach over our table to take serving plates away, WITHOUT even asking if we were done with them....even my soup cup, which clearly had a good portion of soup left in it, was fair game to them. This is NOT okay, Arawan... Take note!!!!! This is a huge pet peeve for many of us diners, and it's annoying to me no matter the kind of establishment or how fancy the restaurant is.  Although we were satisfied with the food that we ordered, it's highly likely that I, personally speaking, will never return. It's a shame too, because there were quite a few dishes that I would have liked to try. But aside from the less-than-quality service that I experienced, it should also be noted that their prices are more on the expensive end of Thai cuisine. I feel that these combined reasons justify my low rating here. For me, the poor service experience trumped the food, and especially at those prices. Why would I pay more money for really the same quality of food that I can get elsewhere and with better service?",441,"['yes', 'high', 'review', 'rating', 'yelp', 'yes', 'food', 'good',

Instead of using  I decided on the mars which had a super cool presentation.  After the dessert is constructed, the waitress flambees some cognac which is later poured over the chocolate dome which then reveals the different layers underneath.  Only issue we had was the fact that they didn't have our first  choices for tea.

They were featured in a show so the popularity grew. They need to get a bigger place because this place was very small. There were about  seats at the counter and maybe  booths, if I'm correct. The first time I was here was almost  years ago and I have been hooked since. I knew that every time I come back to Vegas, I had to stop here. It wasn't popular at the time so there was no wait time and we stayed almost  hours on a Saturday and also got to try some lunch sandwiches. I think there were  of us and we each did the  course dessert for $ and we each ordered different desserts so that we could try them all. I love that they make everything in front of you.   This time we waited about -min but again it was worth it. It was hot but they had some iced lemon water for us. Sweets Raku was the reason I came back to Vegas so I had to drop by no matter what. We stopped by on a weekday so they opened at pm (Mon-Fri, closed Wed?). Therefore the sandwiches weren't available, just desserts. Last time they had edible menu that you tear and dip in this fruity sauce almost like chips and salsa which they currently are not serving. This time they didn't have the  course dessert for $ but  course for $ which came with a sorbet and a main dessert.  But what we did was saved $ and ordered all the different kinds of desserts for $ each and shared. There were  of us again but I think there were  main desserts so we got to try them all. Most of the desserts were the same as  years ago but had different flavors this time. They all still tasted amazing and so rich with flavors. Our bill came out to $ so $ each. So if you're the owner reading this, please get a bigger place or open from pm to midnight on weekdays too, not just the weekends.

3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"""SkinnyFATS""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89118,"After my initial review I was contacted by a manager who offered for me to come back to the restaurant and try a few items on the house. While I was there I also tried a few things at my expense. We ordered the Greek flatbread, the Sweet Chesus, the shrimp tacos, and the salted caramel cookie. The Greek flatbread (Nice to Greek you) had grilled chicken, olives, feta, cucumber, cherry tomatoes, red onion, tzatziki, & balsamic glaze on a flat bread. It was  calories and I got it from the healthy side of the menu. For something that was supposed to be ""healthier"" it was pretty decent. My only complaint is that it had TOO much balsamic on it and I didn't see the point of the giant chunks of cherry tomato. Perhaps it would have tasted better and I could have finished in the restaurant, if the tomatoes had been thinly sliced and there had been less vinegar because it was SO bitter. On a scale one to ten the flatbread scored a . I probably wouldn't order it again to be honest.  The next thing I ordered was the Sweet chesus which is skinnyfats take on a philly cheese steak. It's made with shaved ny steak, pepper marmalade, onions, pepper jack cheese, portobello, cheddar sauce on a hoagie. This was one of the best philly cheese steaks I've ever had. The meat was tender and the bread was soft. I'll definitely eat it the next time I return. (\/) skinnyfats offers two tacos for . which I thought was pretty good deal for a sit down restaurant and You can mix and match! I chose two shrimp taco-dillas: tempura,spicy slaw, pico, chipotle aioli, pepper jack cheese, in a quesadilla shell. Let me tell you, these were the best shrimp tacos I have ever had. The combination of the slaw and chipotle sauce made it sweet, salty, and spicy. So far these tacos are my favorite thing to eat on the menu and if I could eat them everyday I would. These tacos were absolutely AMAZING. (\/) Lastly I had a salted caramel cookie and my mom who isn't a huge fan of sugar took one bite and fell in love. She said this was the best cookie she's ever had. The cookie could be described as how it taste to eat a really good slice of cake. All that was missing was some vanilla ice cream. Go order one of these cookies. You won't regret it! (\/!)  All in all, this was an epic experience and I'm renewed as far as my thoughts about this place goes. Great customer service and great food. I cannot wait to come back and try the other food. SkinnyFats is a place you go if you're not afraid of flavor. Oh and the free wAter (so freshing) is a bonus! One of the best places in Vegas to eat.

3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"""SkinnyFATS""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89118,"I posted a ton of pictures with captions on them so you all can see what the food actually looks like from the pictures they have posted.   The last time I was in Vegas I drove by here.... and kept driving. This place is in an office building complex. It doesn't look like much from outside, that's for sure. When you go inside, the place is clean and super hipster. The menu items are a good amount so you have options.  When you walk in to the cashier asks if you've been there before. If you haven't, like me, she explains how the menu works. It's pretty simple. They serve all the menu items literally from  AM to  PM.  This place is super super small so try to come during those non-rush hours. I went around  o'clock and there was already eight people there, and in about  minutes  to  people showed up... And I was feeling a little cramped. There are seats aligned along the window and lots of plug-ins for you to plug in your computer and or other fancy items... However that's the same wall that you have to walk past in order to get to the cashier, and there are four person settings directly behind where you're standing. So if you're the table directly in front of the cashier you are getting a clear butt shot of every single person ordering. Definitely not going to be my favorite spot to sit.  I finally figured out what I wanted to order. But also wanted to get the opinion of the cashier on what the most popular item was on the menu. She didn't know and rambled off one thing from each category. Not really helpful if you ask me. But she did recommend, if I didn't want something particular, they were happy to substitute anything for anything! That means literally unlimited mix and match combos! I do actually love that. So my order was The Caprizza for . and the off menu item fried pickles with a chipotle aoli for dipping. Oh... and A large black tea unsweetened. The total came to $.. Super pricey for the food items I actually received. The flatbread was about the size of my coach wallet. And was literally sitting on the cardboard! No wax paper down... No interference between literally my flatbread and the cardboard that it came in! When they drizzle the balsamic over my pizza while it was inside the box the balsamic literally was on the cardboard.  I was not a fan of that at all and will definitely not be ordering the flatbread to go again. I did however receive enough fried pickles to feed two or three people. I got this as a to go order because I wanted to eat in my hotel room and do a little work. I wasn't really a fan of the to go order because the food didn't really hold up. (I think???? I mean I haven't ever eaten at the restaurant... So I assume....)   I would go back, and eat inside instead of togo. Maybe try some of their other items that looks pretty interesting... So definitely look for that in the next couple of days. I will update my review then. For now... I am at a firm  stars - disappointed :( )  ------------------------ Ok..... update! Went back  ( Wed around pm ).  ZOIE BLEW MY MIND! Super high energy, Awesome job on welcoming me, knew the menu AND helped me on sifting threw what I wanted and didn't want - with out confusing me or overwhelming me on my order options! Great job ZOIE! She could even had some reservations about a condiment that came on my recommended burger, called me out on it, and excluded it for me... good job AGAIN zoie!   I once again ordered to-go just to make it even... I ended up ordering chix on Broadway, my side was regular fries and I ordered a large black ice tea. ( see Togo order and sandwich attached ) when I opened it up it looked taken care of and nice and neat. After unwrapping and taking the first bite I was not disappointed! The sandwich was big and the chicken was hot, the coding was not too rough... As to mess up the roof of your mouth, you know what I mean people. The fries were hot and my ice tea was fresh. I was so glad to have a good experience with the food this time. I'd read all of these amazing reviews about it but didn't have the same experience as other people. This time it was much much better!  I gave them one more star because of the improvement of the food, and impressive attitude and knowledge of Zoie!! I look forward to coming back next month to see what the dining in experience is like.  -------------- Another update! I just received a message from Lana at skinny fats! She wanted to connect with me on my review to ensure that my customer experience was taken very seriously and was not taken lightly. I have to say I'm super impressed that she took the time to reach out to me and to offer me the opportunity to come back for a different experience. I had already gone back before I got the email... But it was super nice for her to extend the offer. GREAT JOB SKINNYFATS!

3BCsAgo_1i4xMuTyLKMLRQ,"""SkinnyFATS""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89118,"Great concept in offering food for those with special dietary needs like vegan and gluten free without skimping out in taste.  My husband and I didn't need it, but it was nice to see this option for those who do. The place is located in an industrial strip mall with no other restaurants around it. You can't miss the place though due to the graphics used for their signage. Inside they offer a few counter seats and less than ten tables. We came during a busy Saturday after Black Friday and there was a line congregating all the way to the outside. You can peruse the menu while waiting in line but it moves pretty quickly.   I ordered a Classic Burger with a side of Yummus (their play on words for hummus) served with cucumbers (you can opt for pita bread as well). I picked my side so you don't have to get that combo. I substituted their SF sauce (which looked like a thousand island based sauce and pink) for mustard. Mine also came with a fried egg (I asked for sunny side up). My husband ordered the chicken and waffles with fried eggs on top.   My burger was good but nothing special. I really enjoyed the hummus though- thick, yet creamy and with a good lemon flavor.   I think my husband's dish was way better.   Unique concept and pretty creative dishes made for a cool visit. It is far from the strip but there is a billboard right above the restaurant to help you locate it. Despite its odd location, it is super busy so I think that is a testament to its popularity.   Service quick and friendly. You order at the front and take a number, find a seat and they bring everything out to you. There is cucumber and lemon flavored spa like water for self serve in paper cups, if one desires.",317,"['great', 'concept', 'offering', 'food', 'special', 'dietary', 'needs', 'like', 'vegan',

We went on a Thursday night and it started out pretty empty and was completely packed by the time we left.  Like most small restaurants, there isn't a place for people to stand and wait for tables, so when  large groups came in to wait to be seated, they just loitered by all of the tables where people were already eating -- creating a loud and somewhat awkward experience for those up us still eating.  Service was slow.  We had to ask several times for napkins, forks, and our check.  Overall the food was just okay.    The fried rice was incredible.  Unlike any other fried rice I've ever had before -- that alone gives this place it's rating for me.    Otherwise we ordered the toothpick lamb -- which in our case consisted of a lot of fat-- a pea and pork dish (which was really a soup?  It was a bunch of peas, and ground pork in some sort of liquid with absolutely no flavor at all), and finally the wontons in chili oil -- which were very good and very spicy.

Half of the place is a bar\/lounge, other half is restaurant.  We knew the GM, from his many years at SushiSamba, so wanted to try his new place.  Quite obvious he is extremely knowledgeable and enjoys what he does, as he took time to explain each dish's ingredients, preparation and commentary.  Started with seasoned Brussel sprouts, goat cheese croquettes, bacon-wrapped dates and liqueur samples.  All tasted amazing.  Then had raw halibut on ice, with sliced grapes, olives and seaweed, salmon poke.  Next had lobster slices with caviar and greens.  Waffles, roasted duck, duck egg with maple syrup came next, as the GM separated duck meat, breaking egg yolk and adding syrup.  We agreed this was the best dish.

I sampled a variety of small plates, including the Hokkaido scallop crudo, tuna tartare, duck and waffle, and uni\/avocado toast.

Nice crispy leg\/thigh of the duck w\/ a buttery waffle and sunny side egg on top. Oh and the maple syrup...out of this world! I'd put that on everything!  -Chicken thighs \/ Very tasty. Their take on lettuce wraps. The seasoning on the chicken with yummy. I just wish you get more but I guess that's why it's tapas style.  -Skirt steak \/ The steak was tender and grilled well. The chimichurri sauce made the dish.  -Sweet Corn \/ This was my nd favorite dish. Sweet corn, full of flavor, and just a hint of spice.  -Torrejas \/ This was AMAZING!

I stayed at the Wynn this past weekend with my husband for our anniversary. We booked the trip exclusively because we got one of those mailers earlier this year which mentioned a package with free Le Reve tickets and a complimentary meal if you stayed for at least two nights. The rate was pretty good so even though we aren't Vegas people, we booked it and were very happy that we did (I'll write a review for the hotel later and stick to the food on this review.   We chose this place while waiting in The Buffet line earlier that day. Wynn has a great app that shows a couple of their menus and since we were seeing Le Reve that night we picked Allegro because it has a specific menu meant to be had before the show. The app doesn't include all of the onsite restaurants and I was having a little bit of remorse heading into dinner here rather than at one of the more high-end onsite restaurants since the space opens right up into the casino, but when we approached the hostess I just asked to be seated further into the room and they were happy to accommodate. Once seated, I totally forgot we were only maybe  feet from the casino. The lighting was very romantic and the music choice was very different, but nonetheless great (it went from s to current, throw in some country, and then even a light reggae song- it liked it all, but my husband and I noted during the meal that it was an odd mix of songs).  When our waiter, Adam, came we were still debating what to order. The Le Reve menu in person differed a little from the menu on the app, but it still sounded great so I just needed to decide on an entrée and pick a good wine to pair with it. I love wine so I am open to trying something new and Adam recommended the Chianti. As much of a wine lover as I consider myself, I have never tried a Chianti so I told him I'd love a taster before committing. He ended up bringing a couple options for me to try so I could ensure that I had the best wine for my meal. I ended up loving the Chianti and the chef even gave the wine at a very reduced price since he was so certain that it was be the best choice for the meal and wanted to make my decision that much easier.  The Le Reve meal is $\/person and you must have at least  people ordering from that menu. They serve all of the appetizers to you and each person gets to pick a main entrée. The chef curates the meal so you can't customize it, but he is a talented chef who knows what he is doing so customization isn't necessary. I went with the veal marsala and my husband went with the chicken parm. The apps were amazing! I monopolized the Caesar salad while my husband devoured the meatballs. The dressing was great and you could tell that they make it fresh. The eggplant parm was great too as was the bruschetta. They gave us enough time to enjoy our apps without feeling rushed to the main course, while also not giving us too much time to sit with leftovers in front of us. When dinner came I got a second glass of wine (which was served with a very generous pour) and the food was amazing!!! My veal was a little more cooked than I prefer (but I like my steak rare, not medium-rare, I want that thing marinating in it's own blood), but like I said, the chef seemed to have a vision for the meal and he delivered. The entrees were delicious and the wine pairing was perfect!  Going into dinner, I had mentioned to Adam that we were celebrating our wedding anniversary and that I wanted to see if that could do something special for us to celebrate. Also, right before the entrees came out I asked him if he knew of any classy yet relaxing places to listen to classic music and smoke a cigar. He got really excited about my question and after a couple of minutes came back with recommendations. When desert came, he brought our biscotti along with a chocolate cigar. Apparently they had them for a special event and since I mentioned our search for a cigar bar he figured that would be a cute dessert. He was totally right and it was perfect.  In summation, the restaurant was a perfect mix of romantic, classy, and intimate, the staff was accommodating and friendly, and the food and drinks were perfectly designed to compliment each other through the entirety of the meal. At the end of our meal I had some leftovers and they were happy to package it up for us. I ended up with some extra wine as well (that heavy pour gave me more than I was ready for at dinner) and Adam was happy to get me a glass that I could walk into the casino and even into Le Reve with so I didn't have to spend an arm and a leg on the wine cost in there. I already spoke with the manager directly about how great our service was, but I would HIGHLY recommend this place especially to anyone on there was to Le Reve (It is only about  yards from the showroom).",936,"['amazing', 'cant', 'say', 'enough', 'great', 'things', 'place', 'stayed', 'wynn', 'past', 'weekend', 'husband', 'anniversary', 'booked', 'trip', 'exclusively', 'got', 'one',

U0UnBjz9DugW2qRZputKBg,"""Manan Bakery""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89103,"Have tried quite a few of their items with my husband since we have a bit of a sweet tooth and they have for the most part been quite good.   However, the main reason I am writing this review is due to their awesome service recently. I currently live in Oregon, but wanted to send my mom something for her birthday. Being that she loves sweets too, I looked around for bakeries that deliver to her work.   Manan was one of the few places that would deliver to North Las Vegas. Anyway, I called them and spoke to a woman who gave me suggestions on what the most popular items were to send to my mom, and I followed most of her recommendations. I paid over the phone, but she sent me an electronic receipt by text which was great. Then, they texted me a link so that you can track the driver as he delivers the goods.

Ok, they don't have fountain fanta fruit punch (which has a strawberry accent) like in Hawaii... but everything else--delicious.  The service is of a local flavor--the friendly kind. I wanted to try two things not typically ordered together, and the waitress was super flexible about it.  Yes!  The teri beef was delicious--and if it was salty--i only noticed it after the meal. But what I most appreciated was that it had a good char from the grill they have in the kitchen. Also, the cut of meat was not tender in itself (skirt or ny?) but it was handled perfectly. It had both a solid beefy taste and with the slices of meat going across the grain, each piece was mouth tender. It was a beautiful, expert touch. The teri sauce was solid--not like mainland style teriyaki--but local flavor. The sweet sour spareribs--also quite good--a tiny bit oily. big piece of ginger, and turnips, carrots--it was good and hearty--like what you'd make at home.  not as good as the teri beef though. I ended up finishing all the teri beef and taking the SSS home. And PS--it tasted great as leftovers later that night. mac salad was solid Haupia cake--also world class. Reminiscent of Napoleans (Zippy's) in terms of the lightness of the cake.  I would not be surprised if the owner's used to run that bakery or someplace like that. All that cake for only $!    I'm so full again. Two meals in from one plate lunch (and a piece of cake)  Clearly these people know what they're doing. I have to really search to give any suggestions at all: * Is it possible to make slightly better rice?  Pressure cooker might make the rice stand out too? The steamed rice scoops were pretty dense and was the weakest part of the meal.  * I found myself waiting to pay for quite a while at the register.  It'd be nice if the wait staff took the payment--but hey, I won't complain.",356,"['im', 'hawaii', 'might', 'say', 'plate', 'lunch', 'island', 'flavor', 'might', 'better', 'places', 'honolulu', 'wha',

We were visiting from Colorado and ate here for lunch  days in a row because it was so good. It's sort of a small hole in the wall so if your party is larger than + I suggest getting there earlier or calling in your order. We had to do that on the second day because it was packed but they still got our food out quickly.

I would HIGHLY RECOMMEND going out of the beaten path and trying Veggie House!    This is specifically Vegetarian Chinese Food! It's about eating chinese food made out of pressed tofu - you get all the flavors and textures of the dish but there's NO MEAT!  It's not about just eating veggies made different ways - it's really about enjoying chinese classics without the meat!!  We had the Kung Pao Chicken and I tell you - it was flavorful - tasted JUST like Kung Pao Chicken I grew up eating in SF Chinatown! It looked and tasted like chicken but after careful dissection - it was pressed tofu! It was SO GOOD!!!  The table next to us had the Orange Chicken - it looked JUST like orange chicken and they way they gobbled it up - I believe they were happy with it....  Our second dish was the crispy spicy eggplant - where they slice up the eggplant like french fries - fry it up with a mild spicy sauce - so it's crispy, light and SO GOOD!  I honestly will make this place our MUST GO TO place everything we come to Vegas!!! it's a local hangout and it's AWESOME. I wish we could've tried more dishes - will just have to invite more people so we can try more dishes!!  I haven't had great vegetarian chinese food since I went to Hong Kong  years ago! It brought back those fond memories!

Our server was Daniel and he took such good care of us - I don't want to give too much of the experience away, but I will say that if you go into this with an open mind, you will no doubt have a great time. There is no question that you are dining in the absolute pitch dark, but the music and food actually distracts you from the fact that you can't see!   I did see that some other reviewers were complaining about portion sizes - this was not an issue for my husband or myself! Our portions felt huge and they were so filling! My husband is '"" and is not a slender man, so if he left full, everyone else should too! There also seemed to be concerns about the vegan\/vegetarian menu options... if you want a steak, go to a steakhouse. These are unique and flavorful dishes that go beyond what the average palette is accommodated to. Don't let the lack of meat dissuade you; live a little and enjoy the food as it is all handmade and fresh, not the frozen overproduced meat products that you can expect even at the finest of steakhouses (and trust me, I love a good steak just as much as the next guy, but this was next level!).  Recommended for special occasions as this experience is a bit on the pricey side, but worth every dollar! Also, their menu changes seasonally so there's opportunity to go back time and time again.

5qG4UHurI1yEozwn25WAFw,"""BLACKOUT Dining in the Dark""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89103,"Just wow! This truly is an experience! This is not just a restaurant, it truly is an array of feelings you aren't accustomed to.   As you walk in it's a modern, clean front area. Very friendly staff welcome you and give a quick intro to the concept. Then they have you sign a waiver, put away your things in a locker, pick type of flavor: savory, sweet or spicy (the only thing you get to know about your menu). This is also when you tell them if you have any allergies or food aversions. My brother and I are vegan, they were very accommodating and assured us they would not put anything non-vegan in front of us. They said since this is dining in the dark, they take food preparation very seriously and don't cross-contaminate anything, which put me at ease.  Now, we were escorted into the restaurant, in a ""train"" form, with hands on each others shoulders led by the server. It is a surreal experience, it's completely dark (close your eyes, like that!) and all you can sense is smells and noise from tables around you. Felt like being in a haunted house. As we were seated at a table, the servers gave us more directions as far as how the food will be served. After a while memory kicks into gear and you are able to find your way around your dining space. I was drinking my water and cocktail no problem. Feeling my way slowly not to accidentally knock anything down.   The food! I have never felt this much thrill while eating in my entire life! Each bite is a complete mystery, you race through the food trying to experience it and discuss it with your dining buddies. There was an item with a fresh strawberry that I and my husband recognized right away, however my brother just could not guess what it was until we told him! This experience truly makes you focus on the food and enjoy it to its full extent! There were  courses of small size, and by the time you get to dessert you are well stuffed, but the dessert was absolutely perfect ending to the dinner! Whatever that chocolaty goodness was, was amazing and worth another trip to there just for that!  I cannot wait to return and bring more friends! I have been talking about this place to everyone who will listen!  Seriously, thank you Blackout for the wonderful experience, your staff, food and concept was unforgettable!

We started with a caprese salad that had little to no flavor.  When my bucatini all'amatriciana it was nothing like the photo..it was not even bucatini...my a homemade pasta mess of a bad and soggy fetuccini.  The sauce had no flavor.   The Italian manager tried to explain to me that is was bucatini all'amatriciana and I could see he was having a horrible time trying to hide the fact he agreed it was not.  I think replaced it with a tri-colore salad that was basically an over-dressed mixed green.   I figured you can't go wrong with desert so we ordered the apple pie desert with homemade gelato that will go down in history as the worst desert I've had.

My most recent order, however, has been a complete nightmare. At : AM, there was no sign of my delivery, nor was there at :, or at noon. I saw a couple of boxes on my neighbors porch, but I'm not through type and I don't go through other peoples mail. It turns out I should have. Mina finally got back to me, and said that the delivery driver told her that the packages have been delivered. I replied back, that there was nothing on my front porch and that had been home since  AM to see nothing delivered eight hours later. She then replied to me and said that her delivery driver returned and confirmed that the boxes were there, this time with a picture. By no coincidence, there was some shuffling outside of my door about five minutes prior but unfortunately I was in the bathroom and couldn't catch the delivery driver in the act. I attempted to call no less than two dozen times, but the number is automated and no one ever actually picks up. So I drove to the address listed on Google and on their website, only to find out that they haven't been there for sometime.

He got the Mac carbonara, which he later compared to Chef Boyardee, and lobster Benedict, which was ok. I got the shredded salmon pesto salad, which was fine but the temperature contrast of the hot salmon and room temperature salad to the clearly refrigerated apple was a little odd, and the Italian sausage burger which was fine.

They offer a great variety of salads, soups and sandwiches. Order in large or half orders OR try their  combo for only $. and pick any two of your choice. The meal also comes with a side of bread and a chocolate covered strawberry. The portion is just enough to fill you up. Don't be shy to ask for extra or other ingredients (for a little extra cost of course). The process is like a cafeteria style where you order what you like and as you go down the line, you can add soup and there's also a sweets\/dessert case with assorted creme brulee, cakes and bars. There are a plenty of staff so you get super quick service and wait time is never a problem. I always get to-go during lunch time and I'm never there longer than  minutes. Everyone is super friendly and patient to help you with any questions. All their ingredients are fresh and everything is made from scratch each day. Their cleanliness is also a plus.   I'm addicted to their Strawberry Harvest Salad! I've never been a salad girl but after trying this, I'm HOOKED. It's more of a sweet salad though which I don't mind. It has sliced chicken breast, strawberries, dried cranberries, sliced apples, pecans, and fontina cheese along with their unique Strawberry Champagne Vinaigrette. Everything complements each other so well it's amazing how great a salad can taste. I like to add oranges to it as well. I have to eat this at least once a week on my lunch break.

I don't know, but you can sit down and eat your food there.  I think this place would've gotten more stars from me if the portion sizes had been a little bigger, for one - they seemed to be on the small size for my taste; and also, there were only a few vegetarian options on the menu.

There's nothing special about the way it looks or feels, which isn't something I usually complain about, but I feel like a lot could have been added to my experience if the place had a little more character.

We had reservations for five people and were promptly seated at a table that should have been used by four even though there were empty tables around the place.  The service was fine and I cannot fault the wait staff in any way.    We started with drinks of course, Makers on the rocks. For twelve dollars in a town that throws alcohol at you, you would expect a decent pour.  The drinks were heavy on the ice and very light on the Makers Mark.  I have had more generous pours while playing nickel slots.   The big disappointment was the steak. Four of the five had us had steak, mine was a bone in rib eye which while cooked correctly, medium rare, was dry and tough.  All of the steak eaters at the table had similar experiences and two were served cold mashed potatoes.   As a group, we didn't discuss our impressions of the meal until after leaving the table.  We all thought that our experiences and concerns were unique and did not want to ruin anyone else's dinner by complaining, but after leaving we compared notes. At that point, one member of the party returned to speak to the management.  To be honest they did not seem that concerned.   This was once a great steakhouse, and worth the money.

UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"""Therapy""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89101,"Love that this place exists, but wish it was closer to my house. The ambience inside is super hip with that rustic industrial modern vibe going on. It's fancier than some of the other new places (publicus\/glutton\/etc) and more restaurant-y than bar-y. The beer and wine and cocktail selections are quite good, with a couple unique beer offerings I hadn't heard of.  I liked the menu: small plates, ""new American"" style, kinda fancy, heavy on the veggies. Most of these things would be a turn-off to Mr. A., but luckily they had a burger\/sandwich menu, too, to keep him interested. I tried the carrots, brussel sprouts, shrimp scampi, and 'in the gnudi.' Liked them all. Loved the gnudi, but it was a pretty big portion for just one person to eat and my husband isn't about to try something involving 'fig jam.' Also it's really rich, so I couldn't finish it. Also loved the carrots (although, again, too sweet for the Mr.). Brussels sprouts were good and shrimp scampi was good, too, but they weren't extra memorable. For  small plates and  beers, it ran us almost $ with tax and tip, which seems a little high.  Service was friendly and efficient, but it's just too expensive for  stars.

I'm pretty sold on this place when I'm in the area and in the mood to get off the strip (which is almost always). I emailed them for a reservation of  for dinner a few weeks before our trip and it was totally fine. Very prompt response. They sat us on a long table and we decided to split the check three ways inside our group to make ordering a little easier.   Parking: They don't have a parking lot, but you can probably find street parking somewhere close by.   Ambiance: Clean, trendy, welcoming. Slightly dim.   Food:  - Roasted Street Corn: Their take on elote. So good! We kept talking about it on the way back, It's a must get. It was so yummy that we got another order.  - Chicken and Red Velvet Waffle Sliders: These are actually kind of large. I was trying to figure out how to eat it without getting my lipstick everywhere. It was pretty tasty, but I do remember the chicken being a little dry. We cut each side in half and shared between the four of us in our mini group.  - Shrimp Ceviche: Really yummy! Not too acidic either. I was a fan. Shrimp was nice and  fresh too.  - Korean BBQ Porkbelly: So delicious and mouth-watering. Must order! - In The Gnudi: I was sort of surprised by how much I liked this dish. It was a nice break from all the savory since it was also sweet. I'd def order this again. - Big Sexy: The patty was juicy and it the bun was nice and wasn't soggy.   Cocktails:  - Nice and strong. I was able to try ""The Smash"" and ""St. Therapy"". Both were really refreshing and had good flavors.   -Service: The only reason why I'm giving this place  stars is because they messed up our check  times (which took about  minutes to rectify) and I was getting agitated because we were on a tight schedule. Our waiter was very nice though and he checked in on us in a timely manner. Also, the host was really nice too. He was able to accommodate our large party even when I called to change our reservation to an earlier time.   TL;DR: Totally going to be coming to this place when I can.

UidEFF1WpnU4duev4fjPlQ,"""Therapy""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89101,"The location is great, the decor is welcoming, and the food is amazing! The service was on point and we were checked on by a few staff members throughout the night. The only annoying part of the visit was the multiple requests for us to Yelp about experience. Every time we complimented or enjoyed something everyone from the manager to the servers asked us to Yelp the restaurant and to mention them individually.

ghDNHpqETRJGxG5iUtaZtw,"""Lobster ME""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"So... I was at the Venetian Towers for the recent Consumer Electronics Show and ended up eating at Lobster ME every day (as did my colleagues) after I had my first Lobster roll there. In all, I had the lobster roll (x), the lobster melt (the French with Brie), the fries, the chips, the very yummy blueberry lemonade, the slaw (ate every bit of it) and the Lobster Bisque.  Lobster Me gets a solid four stars from me. The food was consistently good even though the place was slammed because of the show. The fries and chips were crisp, the bread nicely toasted, and the bisque surprisingly good for a place that's essentially Fast Food.  The Roll at $ seemed a little expensive and looked small, but it was overflowing with the claw meat and it comes with chips made in the store (not ripples out of a bag) and a condiment sized bit of coleslaw - just enough. Upgrading it to a combo substituting chips for fries and a Drink ($) is a no-brainer as the drink itself is $.  The Melt uses tail meat but seemed a bit skimp but at $, value isn't bad... and comes with the same chips and coleslaw.   The Lobster Bisque was surprisingly tasty (again, for a fast food joint), and the lemonades were also tasty and not too sweet - the blueberry flavored lemonade was really quite yummy.  Service was excellent. I did not think I could ""combo"" a Melt and the register clerk informed me it was the better deal when I wanted both fries and a drink with it. They also honored the long (LONG!) expired coupon that was linked to their Yelp profile when I ""checked in."" Given the crowd and the noise, it was no surprise that they got an order or two mixed up, but they were cheerfully corrected.

The tamales are large with a lot of meat ... we had pork, chicken, and beef, they were all good.  I can't tell you how many tamales I've had that were WAY to much masa for the amount of meat, these are not that.  Basically, they do taste like homemade, not like some uber-modern eatery that's doing all these things to them.  Service was good (not great), ambiance was good, etc.  Really liked the fact that you can order tamales a la carte, didn't want to fill up on rice and beans which are usually very mediocre.  Here's the deal with pricing ... if you order singles, they are $. each (ouch).  If you order a half dozen, they are $. each and for a full dozen, $. each.  Since we had a large group, we ordered .  So if you can order more (to eat there or take home), you will save a LOT.  I don't understand a lot of the other reviews.  I lived  years in CA (Orange County, Bay Area, San Diego County) and RARELY found a good tamale there.  First, don't complain about salt.  A lot of people don't want or can't eat salt, so put your own f*cking salt on.  And the same goes for hot sauce.

Try, maybe every  days I've heard.  That's why they have to revive them in the mini-oven.  Will you get a freshly baked pastry or a two day old one? If you like gambling in vegas, this is your bakery.  i am absolutely open to putting updated information here if someone from management can confirm that the pastries are baked throughout the day, or at least daily.  please tell me what time they enter the stand so i can go there and wait to buy fresh ones.   the service people are nice enough but often not waiting around the register. i know it's boring to stand there--and there's work to be done behind those swaying doors. but i often wait around for - seconds waiting to see if the stand has been abandoned. when no one is there, it does look closed really.    if i were guy savoy...i don't know if i'd feel good about this place with my name on it.  if you had really fresh pastries cycling in (like those humble donut stores in LA) throughout the day, then i'd be a huge fan and willing to put out the ""dough."" but i don't think they grill up a steak  days before at Guy Savoy and then reheat it for you when you order it today, right?  rule of thumb--if the pastries are good, there is usually a line. or constant turnover. there is no need to reheat fresh pastries.  there is hardly a line for this humble set up. if it were better, though, i'm sure there would be a line as the location is actually fairly convenient and the pastries sound\/look good. i want to like it--but for $. for a coffee and a small pastry--it's a

So our burgers were different and cooked to our different preferences too but they were delicious. And BIG. I had a mushroom Swiss burger and I couldn't come close to eating it all.

We most enjoyed the caramel and pistachio, but lemon and raspberry were also delicious.   My complaints: macarons are only available in a multi pack of , including  chocolate, which we really didn't like at all. It would be great to be able to buy singles or at least set our own variety.

9_OPjioLbD9Q_zAeHfv6kw,"""The Red Pot""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89119,"I'm obsessed with buffets and AYCE, and Red Pot is definitely on my TOP  favorite AYCE places in Las Vegas because: ) they have seafood, ) they have sliced meat, ) they have veggie, ) they have soup, and ) WHAT MORE DO YOU NEED IN LIFE?!  Food: you start off with choosing two broths that are set up ying-yang style at your table. I highly recommend the sour tomato because it's flavorful enough to eat with your food and drink with your noodles, yet not overpowering. We also got the  Mongolian herbal broth but that was way too plain, it tasted like water soaked in some of the basic veggies from the fridge. Red Pot offers a vast variety of seafood (from clams to fish balls), pork\/lamb shoulder\/beef\/chicken slices in the freezer, and vegetables (from bamboo to bok choy). Plus, two counters worth of sauces to mix a concoction to your taste.   Price: my parents and I were so impressed with how cheap it was because we definitely ate our money's worth and more. It's $ per person for lunch and % off for checking in Yelp. Dinner is $ per person and % off discount with Yelp. If you think AYCE sushi or kbbq is great, TRY HOT POT!   Service: the service was mediocre. I had to ask for my drink to be refilled twice, and they never check on us; keep in mind, only four other tables were occupied besides us and my group came right at  AM. Luckily, the food in the fridges\/freezers were always stocked, and everything seemed clean and not cluttered --so that's a plus!  Overall: HIGHLY RECOMMEND. Now that the weather is getting colder, hot pot is the best way to enjoy a meal with family and friends. It's affordable, delicious, and a fun hands-on lunch or dinner experience. I'm taking  star away because some of their items were super frozen and not the freshest, and their soup choices are disappointing.",331,"['im', 'obsessed', 'buffets', 'ayce', 'red', 'pot',

L_ZLtfHvfzfoNVQ0-okTXg,"""SW Steakhouse""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"SW is pricey but our meal was well worth it.  We had dinner Friday night at SW.  The place was packed the entire time we were there.  I overheard a hostess say if you wanted a table on the patio overlooking the waterfall you need to make reservations  months in advance.  So, be advised if you are wanting that experience.  We had a view of the waterfall from our table, and the weather was nice so they opened the wall to allow the breeze in.  It's definitely a cool place to have a meal.  Service was great throughout the evening.  We had a team of guys helping our table, and we also utilized the sommelier, who was very friendly and helpful.  We gave him a price range and a couple of bottles that we liked, and he provided us with  great recommendations.  No attempt to upsell either, which given how nice SW is, that was refreshing.  You are going to get a bread basket with pretzel buns, another type of bread, and these cheesy, bacon rolls.  Ignore the other bread and have the cheesy bacon rolls!  Everyone at our table loved them and I am pretty sure we all had at least .  I know I did.  I know everyone says not to fill up on bread and that's certainly true, but these rolls are worth not ignoring the bread basket.  To start, I had the tuna tartare.  The tuna was of very good quality and fresh.  However, there were too many pickled veggies and not enough gochujang for my taste.  The veggie to tuna ratio was off, and the tuna should have been the star of the dish.  It was good to be sure, but the construction was off.  I split the  ounce tomahawk ribeye with another guy at the table, and we all shared the following sides:  black truffle creamed corn, au gratin potatoes, asparagus, and mushrooms.  The server advised us that steaks at SW have a crust, and he was right.  This thing was textbook.  It had a slight crunch without being acrid at all.  If this wasn't a perfect steak crust it was pretty damn close.  The beef was dry aged  days and had the flavor and depth you expect of a dry aged prime steak.  It was cooked perfectly as well.  It's not cheap but it's a repeat order should I return.  The asparagus and mushrooms were prepared simply.  You have to like both of these items to like these sides, because there was nothing added.  The au gratin potatoes were small but excellent.  We had a group of  and needed to order another batch.  They were seasoned well, appropriately cheesy, and had a great crust.  SW may be fancy, but this was a great version of a classic steakhouse side.    While the potatoes were good, the winner of the side derby goes to the black truffle creamed corn.  Everyone at the table loved this stuff.  It had a lot of truffle flavor but it wasn't overpowering the dish.  And, the corn was creamed well, it wasn't too thick, but also wasn't runny.   star side.  You are going to pay a bunch for a meal at SW, but if you're eating there you are at the Wynn.  Steve Wynn built his empire on luxury, not deals.  I can't believe it took me so long to get to this place, but I would return on a future trip for sure.",580,"['sw', 'pricey', 'meal', 'well', 'worth', 'dinner', 'friday', 'night', 'sw', 'place',

The drink was refreshing, love them yummy bobas!  If you are undecided on what to get they have a variety of drinks on their menu including milk teas, flavor teas (choice of green tea or black tea), slushees, iced teas, fresh fruit smoothies, hot drinks and specialties. You can add your favorite toppings (tapioca, jelly or pudding) with any of these drinks. They have a few snacks as well, not a big selection, but you have a sure thing... popcorn chicken!  We got our drinks quickly and off we went. Friendly staff and fast service. When in town we'll be sure to come back here for some snow desserts!

That was quickly remedied when I saw the server and realized, ""Oh remember that guy from Pho Annie? Wait, they're all from Pho Annie.""  I ordered my typical BBH (Bun Bo Hue). Certainly not the best I've had, but by the time I reached the bottom of the bowl, I concluded that I really enjoyed it. The broth had a definite fish sauce aroma at first.

We had every intention of posting a positive review for our first delivery, but never got the chance as we placed our second order on \/\/. Our first experience on \/ was pretty good with the exception of the  minute delivery wait time.   We ordered  individual dinner boxes at $. each, which includes -choice of rice or lo mein noodles,  -side  dish and -choice of entree. My husband ordered the Orange Chicken while I ordered Kung Po Shrimp, which cost $. extra [for shrimp]. China Joe's did not disappoint and made a great first-impression with [their] tasty egg rolls and lo mein noodles.   We ordered again on \/\/ - this time around I ordered Kung Po Chicken and my husband ordered Teriyaki Chicken. We both ordered the lo mein and added  full order of egg rolls to include extra dipping and soy sauce, with an emphasis on ""dont forget to bring chopsticks"".  Unfortunately, our entire meal was a BIG disappointment. The egg rolls were ice cold and ""blah"" tasting - blah, blah, blah... AND the chicken on both entrees was so tough that we had to chew, chew, and keep chewing just to get thru our meals lol. We only ate enough to satisfy ""our hunger pangs"", then threw the rest away in the garbage can -  which meant, NO Chinese leftovers for breakfast or lunch the following day - a total bummer :(. Also, my driver forgot to bring our chopsticks, IS a big part of the dining experience in my opinion.   We did not bother to call and complain. To be frank, I am growing very tired of the lack of consistency and subpar food when it comes to delivery and takeout dining. We've decided to simply move past this bad experience and continue our quest to find a suitable Chinese restaurant that delivers quality food in our area.  Since our first dining experience with China Joe's was favorable, we gave them  stars. As for our nd visit, we reluctantly give China Joe's  star as the Yelp site does not offer patrons the ability to rate a company at zero stars or below.     [Post script] -  I just learned that China Joe's uses third-party delivery companies such as GrubHub to deliver its food orders. Since I live only a few blocks away, it now makes sense why both deliveries took over -minutes for delivery.",430,"['hi', 'everyone', 'high', 'hopes', 'finding', 'better', 'chinese', 'delivery',

We wanted to get one vegas buffet visit in during our trip.   The best options were the pastas- mac and cheese, ravioli, bow tie pasta. Lots of creamy sauces!Some of the Asian offerings were pretty good too especially the General Tao's chicken. Spicy, sweet and cooked nicely so it was crispy on the outside and moist on the inside.   I have a massive sweet tooth so the dessert section was heaven! I highly recommend the pineapple upside down cake and the Black Forest cake. Did not like the coconut cream pie or the apple cobbler.

Our cousin said this place has bomb custard pie! If you're from Hawaii, you're used to getting bomb custard pie from Zippy's and Foodland or any other average Hawaii grocery store. Here in Vegas, custard pie isn't such a hot commodity, so when Your Cousin says ""custard pie"", you just reply, ""lead the way""!   We arrived on a Saturday afternoon at around pm. The place was semi-packed, we were rushing so we opted for the take-out side of the restaurant. I ordered the kalua pig with poke plate, we shared a custard pie and a side of chicken katsu.   When you walk in, the place is kind of confusing...to the right you'll see a sign in sheet on a table with a sign directing Wait to Be Seated, straight ahead at the end of the take out side of the restaurant you'll see an ordering window with Poke Bowl only menu, and to the left you'll see the take out window with bakery showcase!   I was overwhelmed by all the signage, I just picked a seat and waited for my other half to order us lunch. It took a while to get our order but it was clear that the place was busy. Our food was good, I like that they had shoyu for us on the side next to the soda machine. I also like that they have free refills in the self serve soda machine.

DzKl51tivGJMLiNsQqf38w,"""Island Sushi & Grill""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89123,"My family had a HORRIBLE experience at this restaurant today. We came in for Happy Hour and got there at pm. We had a one year old baby with us who is very picky with food so we had to bring fries with us from a fast food restaurant. The woman who brought us to our table told us that we cannot have outside food inside Island Sushi but I explained to her that it is just food for the baby and to please just let us keep it. She said she would have to ask her manager if that was okay. She spoke to the manager and he came to our table and told her our baby can't keep the food because it is their ""policy"". So for the next hour, our baby just sat there hungry while everyone ate.   So we ordered our food and our first roll got to our table. But none of us can eat because they didn't provide any plates. We sat for a while waiting for someone to come by and nobody came. My sister stood up and went to the front and told them we didn't have plates. They took  mins after to finally bring plates. Next, they brought my niece's fish but she couldn't eat it because they didn't bring any forks. We waited again for someone to come by and after  minutes, my husband stood up to ask for forks at the front. And it kept getting worse. We ordered rice with the fish but that didn't come until  minutes later after the fish. The miso soups didn't come until  minutes after we ordered (which if you go to sushi restaurants often, you know that's the first thing they place on your table). They did not give wasabi and ginger until we asked for it (again, sushi restaurants ALWAYS give this automatically) and when they gave us the wasabi, it didn't come with any bowls so my husband had to get up again to the sushi table to ask for one. In total, our family had already gotten up  times to ask for stuff. Halfway done through our food, we had to remind them that they still haven't brought  rolls that we ordered. Only the manager checked up on us once. Nobody else asked if we needed anything, which is weird considering there were only about  people in the restaurant so they weren't that busy for us to be ignored.   Worse yet, the food was horrible. The sushi tastes like the refrigerated ones you can buy at grocery stores. The raw fish were thin and dry. We paid half price for them because of Happy Hour but even so, their sushi is not worth it.   Never coming back to this place again. The only good thing about this place is that the employees were friendly, the manager especially. My guess is that they're just unorganized and forced to follow stupid rules by the owner.",501,"['family', 'horrible', 'experience', 'restaurant', 'today', 'came', 'happy', 'hour', 'got', 'pm', 'one',

Beauty & Essex was really pretty, but the food kind of fell flat for me.  My husband and I started with the Ceasar Toast with crispy chicken skin. The dressing was a bit overwhelming and it was missing the crunch of the skin I was hoping for.  We shared the empanadas, which were good, but tasted mostly of jalapeno and melty cheese; no complaints, but not exactly special and were only four small pieces. We ended the savory portion of the meal with the chicken meatballs (three to an order). Again, they were just fine...not something I would suggest or eat again.  My husband read that the donuts with dipping sauces were supposed to be good, so we ended the meal with those. The portion was pretty good for the price (a pleasant surprise!) and the dipping sauces were rich in their respective flavors. The donuts were oversized donut holes coated in cinnamon sugar. I had no issues with them but again, I'm unsure as to why they came so highly recommended.  Overall, it wasn't bad, but it wasn't great. As other reviewers have said, it was very loud.

uh7DUWtPoZkuEE05fghJ_w,"""Beauty & Essex""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"I was not expecting to love this place so much. I figured it was more about the vibe and novelty of the whole Beauty and Essex pawn shop in the front gimmick... I was so so so wrong, and I am so glad I was. I hadn't read the reviews and hadn't heard anything from friends who had dined here but I'd love to shout from the rooftops about how delicious the food here is, and exciting too..  Our waiter was amazing, I think his name was David (?), he was top notch and wish I could just have him as my waiter everywhere I go. Stellar job, amazing attitude, he made the experience fun and we were so grateful to have him as our waiter. That being said, I am not sure if I've had a dinner that I enjoyed as much as I enjoyed our dinner at Beauty & Essex. We ordered the ahi tuna tacos, and then we ordered another order of them after we finished our entire meal - yes, they were that good. The flavors are perfectly balanced and these are just SO good. We may have gone back the next night and picked up a quick order of these ""to go"" because we could not stop thinking about them! We also ordered caesar toast (yum!), the french onion dumplings (holy moly!), the grilled cheese and tomato soup dumpling (amazing!), scallops (prepared perfectly) and... I think that was it. Oh, and bone marrow (ahh, why you gotta be so good?!).   Everything was phenomenal and I could have sat there all night, eating everything over and over and over again.  We had to get dessert, right? The donuts are killer good. Light and fluffy served with  sauces (chocolate, butterscotchy caramel and a raspberry sauce) - *sigh* these were so freakin' amazing. We also ordered the PB ice cream thing which comes topped with pretzels, I don't even have the words to describe how amazing this one was. Beauty & Essex, you done did a great job and I cannot wait to come back. Everyone who works here is so friendly and you really don't get that pretentious vegas vibe that a lot of other places give off. Oh, it is loud inside, but you wont be talking much because the food is really that incredible and there are no words great enough to describe it.  I really hope this place stays as good as it is right now and doesn't go through that rough patch of bad service and inconsistency.

Decided to grab an early breakfast here during our stay at The Delano. Since we were part of the am crowd, we luckily did not have to wait for a table. After being seated and greeted by a number of super friendly workers, we examined our menus and decided what to order. My fiancé went for the Chicken & Waffles and I had a craving for their healthy version of a Breakfast Burrito. Obviously, we both started off with some coffee and it was pretty good. Almost could've been too bitter for me since I've been taking my coffee black these days, but it wasn't so I was pleased and caffeinated.  We quickly got our meals and we were both so excited because it looked delicious and the presentation was on point. I had a bite of the Chicken & Waffles which was really yummy. Chicken was nice and fried (just the way I like it sans bones) and the waffle was light and fluffy, but still had some weight to it to absorb the syrup. My burrito was SO GOOD. A whole wheat wrap filled with scrambled egg whites, asparagus, roasted peppers and cheddar cheese (I added this in extra because I  cheese). Unfortunately, the avocado was outside the burrito (I'm guessing for presentation purposes), but that didn't stop me from eating it! My burrito also came with hash browns and homemade ketchup. Hash browns were great - crispy and thick. The ketchup was just okay in my opinion, but that could also be because I'm used to the sugar-filled, processed Heinz ketchup lol. To go with my meal, our waitress also brought me their hot sauce made in-house. Now this was BOMB. Spicy and delicious, yummmm!  We left with full and happy stomachs, although a little lighter in our pockets (since this is vegas and inside a hotel, the food wasn't cheap, but the prices were not so extravagant that it wasn't worth it to splurge a little bit).  A must try if you're staying in the Mandalay Bay hotels!

KalAJyO0Zpg3K1wVwYXBHA,"""Marché Bacchus""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89128,"This is a somewhat hidden gem. It's oddly placed in a tiny stripmall smack dab in the middle of a residential area. I was referred here by a previous coworker. I've been here three times now and have had pretty decent experiences each time. Truffled goat cheese Napolean, um yes please!! The philo puffed pastry is so flaky and buttery, it melts in your mouth.. the goat cheese, mmmmmm! Highly recommended! Service here is hit or miss.. The lobster salad croissant is ok...there are way better things to eat here, take it from me..,I learned the hard way.!  The turkey sandwich on the lunch menu, yum!  The burger is one of the best I've ever had in my life! No lie! The Brie is the icing on the cake, so to speak.. I love my red meat, and they cook it to perfection! I can't even explain how melty in my mouth their tenderloin and mashed potatoes is..  I swear, you can't go wrong with whatever you order!  No cocktails here, it's pretty much a wine specialty place.. however, when I mentioned I'm from Michigan where there are a ton of vineyards up north, the waiter suggested they may be able to order me a special wine! Much to my dismay, the request was declined.  The stocked Riesling is on the sweet side, which is how I like it. If you order a bottle with dinner, they charge a $ service fee. I don't exactly care for this, but it is what it is. I just would like to be told ahead of time. I've got $, just let me know!  The view is so pretty. The facility sits on a tiny lake..it's the desert, not the Pacific coast..we take what we can get! Once here for lunch, a friendly duck even came inside to greet patrons! I do enjoy watching the black swans on the lake...but you can't see them at all at night. It can be kind of cold in the winter (even with the provided heaters).. perhaps another glass of wine will warm you up :-) One of my favorite local places, I'll be back!",358,"['somewhat', 'hidden',

We chose Marche Bacchus because we love French cuisine, read the reviews and snagged a  point Table on OpenTable! We arrived and started exploring the wine shop. To our utter delight, we found one of our favorite Sparkling Whites (Saint-Hilaire) and ordered a bottle to have with our dessert course. Our table was perfect - outside right on the edge of the lake! Our server, Nicole, was wonderfully attentive and helpful. We started with the Escargot - delicious and garlicky! The bread was warm, crusty and served with real whipped butter. We decided to split the Summer Salad with rhubarb dressing - I loved it. Hubby thought the dressing was too sweet. I ordered the Veal Braciole and Hubby got the Red Wine Braised Beef - both delicious! I ordered a glass of Chateauneuf-du-Pape and Hubby got a Barolo - NICE!! We had a hard time deciding on entrees because there were so many things we wanted to try. For dessert, I had the Fromage ( different selections with caramelized onions and peppers, grapes and candied walnuts - YUM!) and Hubby got the Warm Chocolate Lava Cake with Chocolate Gelato instead of Vanilla Ice Cream. The cake was not as warm as he expected but was delicious none-the-less.

If you are a wine lover, you are in luck as the front entrance is basically a wine shop, containing all the best wines!  I was in wine heaven from the first step walking into the front door. Pick your bottle and your waiter will bring it out to your table.  Then continuing outside on the terrace where seating was overlooking the lake was incredible.  They had outdoor fire places going and acoustic music as well. They also have floor to ceiling windows for colder weather, so you can still enjoy the lake view.  I keep going back and bringing all my friends, whenever anyone is looking for a special night, Marche Bacchus is first on the list to suggest.  Did I forget to mention the food is incredible and the service A+.  Do not miss this stop if you are here on vacation---it is well worth the drive out from the strip to have lunch or dinner here!

-RJ216TTIghZshCkUlD1WQ,"""Sushi Takashi""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89146,"This place is phenomenal. -courses? Heck yeah! Heed other Yelper's warning. There will be so much food.   I made reservations for dinner here on New Year's Eve. The service is impeccable. We were constantly being check by our servers making sure everything was to our liking.   A few changes to the menu based on the other Yelpers who tried this place before me. They included Salmon on their Teriyaki and removed the Baked and replaced it with Vegetables (Asparagus or Broccoli).   Here are the dishes that really stood out for me (good and bad):   . Garlic Edemame: Way better than the regular one or the Pepperoncini. Do not think the pepperoncini will taste anything like the pickled peppers. It was just edemame with chili flakes.  . Super-White-Tuna & Scallop Carpaccio: These were delicious! They tasted fresh and sweet which was really a surprise to me because I personally do not like raw food but I totally made an exception with this one.   . Hamburger: Okay, this one is pretty weird and even our server admits it. I feel like it should not be part of the  course dinner. I'm guessing this is for people who do not really like sushi\/raw fish so they can have an option. But this seriously left me dumbfounded. It is a full burger meal with fries and everything. It was not until after I finished the burger that out of curiosity, I asked if it can be changed to the other burger options (Teriyaki, Takashi, Teriyaki Tsukune, Salmon Fry Burger) and they said yes but it will be an additional charge. Good to know for future reference.  . Beef Sukiyaki: This was really delicious. The soup was a little sweet to my taste but the beef was so tender that I still loved the dish over all. Definitely get this over the Diced Steak. The steak was dry and the flavor was peppery so I was not really a fan of that. Plus who wants hard steak anyway?  . Corn and Egg Soup: I would recommend something else rather than ordering this. I was pretty disappointed with it. A little too sweet too.  After two hours of battling against food, I am proud to say that I finished. They should really give some sort of medal\/award to people who can actually finish. That was a lot of food! Next time I come back, no more -course meal. I would come back to order little bits of things that I liked.   Thank you, Chef Takashi. That was definitely a good way to end my .",430,"['place', 'phenomenal', 'courses', 'heck', 'yeah', 'heed', 'yelpers', 'warning', 'much', 'food', 'made', 'reservations', 'dinner', 'new', 'years',

We recently discovered this place and thought ""hey, we should try it out!"" So we did- and we regretted it lol. It was pretty busy when we got there which is understandable, its a Saturday. So we waited in a long line to order our food. My boyfriend got a plain coffee, I got a hot latte, and we got one sandwich to split. My boyfriend got to get his coffee instantly since they have the coffee out on the counter for you, but I had to wait. In fact, not only did we have to wait quite a bit for our one sandwich, the sever didn't realize I didn't have my latte until after we got our sandwich.

And as she turned her head she whipped my fave with her ponytail! Wtf??? We sit down and get water. We ordered hot tea and we got our appetizer before the tea. The spring rolls were not only disgustingly gross and Not fresh but the shrimp were not even cleaned! Disgusting!!!!! We got our pho and I asked to order some eggrolls since the spring rolls were nasty! Needless to say I never got my eggrolls because they never put my order in. I ended up paying $ for the most disgusting Vietnamese food I've ever had! And our table was dirty! Sticky and dirty! The place even felt dirty!  Do NOT go to this place, unless you like dirty shrimp, old wilted lettuce, horrible service and like dirty dining! This place should be on news for their Dirty Dining segment....

SwAZBCyFtVo_8vkRbJhdkA,"""Culinary Dropout""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89169,"Holy shit. My boyfriend and I came here for lunch, and Jesus Christ we'll never come back. We have both bartended and served in the industry for  and  years, respectively, we tend to go into places with an open mind toward what a place has to offer.  First off, our server was training a new girl, which usually means better service, you're getting a two for one for gods sake! At the very least you get  \/ times the service because one of them is learning. But sweet Jesus we ended up with \/ what we would expect from a single server. They disappeared for long periods at a time, we had to specifically ask for napkins after receiving finger foods, and NEVER got silverware, at any point in time. We got our appetizers and watched it get cold as we continued to wait for our FIRST round of cocktails.  Apparently the bartender was training as well, those two menu ready cocktails took over  minutes (yes, we looked at the time) in a restaurant that was MAYBE \/ capacity, including the indoor, outdoor, AND bar seating.  The drinks were so unbalanced I wanted to smack whomever trained the trainer AND trainee of those bartenders. It's hard to fuck up an old fashioned once you know how to make it, but watered down whiskey with a bourbon cherry on top does NOT an old fashioned make, my friend.  The menu and cocktail list, along with the quirky name, seemed to have the potential to be a great restaurant and cocktail stop. But the service was horrendous. If this restaurant were not riding on the back of the Hard Rock Casino big brother, I would laugh at the blatant foreshadowing of a business ready to close its doors before the idea could blossom into a singularly successful business. Beyond the total disregard for anything mimicking customer and\/or industry service, to see new additions being trained to act as such was blasphemous for all proper restaurants and bars in the world.   Shame on you and your mooch business model mentality, that clearly relies on a presence inside of a large, profitable casino, that overrides the necessity for an individual attempt at creating a

The cashier went back to the office and retrieved the managers card which I decided to call from the car.  Dayania Ortega picked up the phone and I let her know I was not happy. She decided to lecture me saying I didn't order correctly and should have said the fried chicken tacos. I asked her if maybe the girl at the window should have asked and she told me no because they have such a large menu.  As she was lecturing me on how to correctly  order the ""Fried chicken tacos,"" I again pulled into drive thru and identified the Fried Chicken tacos as manager Ortega had told me according to proper procedure at El Pollo Loco.  After ordering the EXACT way she told me the window girl again said sorry we are out of those......""I said no the Fried Chicken Tacos"" and she said yes sir we are out of them! Are you F*#*ing kidding me??!!  To top it off Ms. Ortega got on the mic and said we can make them for you but it will be a wait!  This restaurant is the worse I have ever been too, which really sucks as when they get the food right it is good.

After all the American food we've been eating in this trip I wanted some rice on our last full day in Las Vegas... I'm not talking about Spanish rice or risotto rice or rice pilaf... although they're all yummy too, but I wanted good ole' white rice (not Uncle Ben's) or fried rice so where do we go? we head to Las Vegas Chinatown.   This Chinatown Plaza in Las Vegas isn't anything like the Chinatown in San Francisco oh, heck no. This place is much smaller and clean! This is not too far from the Strip either. It's clean (okay, I said it twice) and easy to navigate to. Oh, but I digress... we were looking forward to a nice Chinese food dinner when we saw this ""Kapit Bahay"" Filipino eatery in the corner of this plaza. I wondered if this was the same fast food restaurant located at the Hawaiian Marketplace on the Strip which is no longer there when we looked for it. Anyway, at this location at the Chinatown Plaza we were glad that it was still open that late at the time.   This 'turo-turo'-style family run restaurant had one other customer so we had the whole restaurant to ourselves pretty much. We each had the -item combo ($.) and when I saw the menudo still available I wanted it. We had some type of beef (not sure of the name) and also sinigang. The food was excellent and flavorful... definitely satisfied our hunger. The middle of the restaurant had a table-full of popular Filipino snacks! you name it they had it! Bought me a couple packages of my favorite Choc-Nut. The elder lady (""lola"") behind the counter was very nice and friendly and definitely showed us that Filipino hospitality... not just to us but also to foreign nationals that came in and bought food ""to go"".

O3OH5IEFMPtz7mPKakPZ3Q,"""Japaneiro""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89113,"We found this place thanks to Yelp on a visit to Vegas a few weeks ago.  We went later in the day and I thought we were lost in the boonies with all the road construction and what looked like abandoned strip malls.  Turned into a small center with a Bruddahs restaurant facing the street.  On entering it looks like a hallway of a restaurant, albeit a warm, cozy, well designed hallway.  I ordered an iced tea and got what looked like cloudy water.  Turns out it was rice tea.  If you know the sweet rice tea at the end of Korean meals, that's what this is minus the sugar, cinnamon and actual bits of rice floating in it.  Taste was not bad at all, just not what I expected.  Service was fast, informative and friendly.  I was tempted to try some of the more exotic (read: expensive) specials, but we just got to Vegas and I didn't hit Megabucks yet.  So we ordered the rock shrimp to start and I got the chawanmushi and Japaniero Special Yakisoba Udon.  The rock shrimp was outstanding!  Reminded me of honey walnut shrimp at Chinese restaurants, but this was so succulent with a little crunch.  Taste was perfect.  I could eat a heaping plate by myself.  The chawanmushi came out with dried seaweed sprinkles on the top.  The sprinkles were like concentrated ocean and a little distracting, but the chawanmushi itself was beautiful.  So creamy and flavorful and seemed to melt on the tongue.  The Yakisoba udon was the best Yakisoba I've ever had.  Even the squash blossom purée, which I thought was odd, worked well.  A couple friends got the regular noodles, but I felt the udon noodles really complemented the flavors more and gave a better chew to the dish.  I savored the last few bites.  The only reason I didn't give a  was that it was a little pricey for the portions.  But that's it.  Everything else was wonderful.  It was an unexpected gem on our first night in Vegas and worth the drive from the Strip.  I will definitely make an effort to go back next time.",359,"['found', 'place', 'thanks', 'yelp', 'visit', 'vegas', 'weeks', 'ago', 'went', 'later', 'day', 'thought', 'lost', 'boonies', 'road',

faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"""Yardbird Southern Table & Bar""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,". rating over  reviews (at the time of the the writing of this review)?  Yardbird has a lofty reputation and as a result, our expectations were high.  Yardbird lived up to its considerable hype.  We had lunch at Yardbird on a Friday afternoon.  There were  of us and we were able to walk right in.  I liked the joint, especially the random pictures of Cash, Elvis, Bob Dylan, etc. that were cycling through on the wall.  We were approached fairly quickly by a server to take our drink orders.  Good beer list, decent wine list.  It was a little early for me so I went with a housemade lemonade.  As expected, a restaurant that specializes in southern fare makes fantastic lemonade.  It's $ a glass, and I do not know if that comes with refills since I did not get one.  If you don't get refills that's a hefty price for lemon juice, water, and sugar, even when the mixture is as good as this.    The  of us split the chicken and waffles, chicken biscuits, fries, mac and cheese, and coleslaw.  You may bristle at $ for the famous chicken, watermelon, and waffles, but it was a lot of food.  You get  pieces of chicken plus a large serving of watermelon and the thick waffle.  The food comes out QUICK.  As in, within  minutes of us ordering it.  I guess when you have something as labor intensive as fried chicken as the star of the show you just constantly make batches of it.  But, it did not suffer in quality.  This chicken was definitely fresh, it had not been sitting under a salamander prior to its arrival at our table.  I had the breast and thigh of the chicken.  Both were juicy and flavorful, but the dark meat was better.  The skin is crunchy and seasoned very well.  No need for additional salt and pepper.  The chicken is just good quality fried chicken.  Is it the best I've ever had?  Probably not, but it is damn good and I didn't have any qualms about the price.  The waffle has a nice slight crunch to it and a chewy center.  Paired with the bourbon maple syrup it was very good.  Paired with the chicken it was great.  We had to ask for more syrup, the waffle to syrup ratio was off due to the size of the waffle.  The spiced watermelon didn't land with any of us.  It was okay, and it's good quality watermelon.  We just did not love it.  The sides, in order of preference:  mac and cheese, fries (with bacon ranch that they should bottle and sell), and cole slaw.  The slaw was good, its served with a crisp of chicken skin, but it couldn't compare to the mac and cheese.  This stuff was creamy and incredibly flavorful.  We all loved it.  The chicken biscuits were another winner.  The flavorful chicken on a flaky biscuit with some very good pepper jelly was a strong combination.  It took me awhile to get to Yardbird after its opening.  I will not wait so long next time, and will likely return on my next trip to Vegas.  Highly recommended.",533,"['rating', 'reviews', 'time', 'writing', 'review', 'yardbird', 'lofty', 'reputation', 'result', 'expectations', 'high', 'yardbird', 'lived', 'considerable', 'hype', 'lunch',

Dinner Experience: Service - Fantastic. We ate early so it wasn't busy at all. Our waiter was friendly, we were seated quickly and our food came out really fast. The one small bummer here was that we weren't done with our appetizer when our food came out.  BLT appetizer was outstanding. We had the friend chicken and mac n cheese for dinner and it was so delicious. The chicken was juicy and flavorful and the mac and cheese was so well done.   Brunch: I think I loved our brunch even more than dinner. I got the ham biscuits and the potato hash. Let me tell you, that potato hash is made of sunshine and dreams - it's that good. I don't know how they make hashbrowns creamy and crispy all at once, but they do and it's a beautiful marriage. I also have to give a special shout out for their coffee. Vegas is filled with really crappy and expensive coffee. This was some of the most rich, full bodied coffee I've had in that town. I would have taken an entire thermos if they let me.   Overall - do yourself a favor and come here. It's relatively new and I don't think everyone has caught on to how fantastic the food is. Stop going to gross places like TGI Fridays and come here.

faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"""Yardbird Southern Table & Bar""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"My friends and I went here for a birthday dinner and it was a pretty good place for a  decent sized party. It's a pretty spacious venue and definitely nicely decorated. They sat our group by the kitchen and most of you would think that being seated there would be annoying but it wasn't. It was fun watching the food getting prepped and such. It definitely was a well oiled machine. Our server was great and all the staff that we encountered were friendly. Now on to the food...  We split four appetizers between  people and our server was gracious enough to add to more deviled eggs and biscuits to our order - an order usually comes with .   Deviled eggs - this was delicious. I generally am not a fan of deviled eggs but this was seasoned nicely and the flavor of dill was spot on.   Kale salad - this dish was okay.  It was lightly dressed, they used baby kale and that's all I really have to say about that.  Mac & cheese - when this item arrived at our table, I wouldn't have thought that it could be split between  people. That little mini cast iron sure fed all of us. It was creamy and cheesy and I wanted more.   Classic buttermilk biscuits - I am also not a fan of biscuits. This however was fluffy, soft and buttery. It also included some butter and jam in cute little jars. Add some of that on the biscuit and darn it, you would want another one.   On to the entrees. The boyfriend and I decided to share\/split two entrees.  He had the St. Louis style pork ribs - we asked for it to be dry and BBQ sauce on the side. He ordered the full rack and that was plenty for two people. The rub had a nice flavor and the meat fell off the bone.  Dip the meat in some sauce and it was even better. I ordered Llewelyn's fine fried chicken. An order came with a thigh, breast, drumstick and wing. Our server told us that it was a good size serving and boy, it was really a good sized serving. Most of the group ordered this and most of us didn't finish it because it was that filling. The chicken was moist and nicely flavored. I think the only thing that we didn't like about it was that the skin wasn't crunchy enough. But this is just a preference.   Oh we all ordered cocktails\/drinks and they have a nice selection. I had the southern peach and it was nice and refreshing. Make sure to order one when you dine here.   Overall, it was great ambience, the staff was friendly, and the food was great.  Also, if I'm ever around one of these establishments, I would go back.",474,"['friends', 'went', 'birthday', 'dinner', 'pretty', 'good', 'place', 'decent', 'sized', 'party', 'pretty', 'spacious',

faPVqws-x-5k2CQKDNtHxw,"""Yardbird Southern Table & Bar""",3.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,I feel like  Stars is pretty generous for the review on this place. First service was horrible. I think we only saw our waitress once after we ordered eventually having to track down a manager just to get our check and then left cash so we didn't have to wait longer.   Chicken and waffle was way overpriced for what it was. It was just fried chicken and one waffle. Nothing exciting about the flavoring or anything of the fried chicken. The syrup was a nice touch but not worth the $ for fried chicken and a waffle.   The menu is very small for a brunch menu. Not a lot of options. Luckily we were seated next to the kitchen and after not seeing anything my husband liked he saw a burger come out of the kitchen and asked the waitress. She was very reluctant to bring us the dinner menu and when she did told us the only thing we could order off it was the burger ( it was  in the afternoon not  in the morning) but then we continued to see sandwiches and other dinner items come out of the kitchen while waiting for our food. The poached egg dish had a very odd overpowering lemon flavor to the sauce that ruined the whole dish. The burger was super greasy.   We ordered the peach cobbler instantly cause we had friends tell us it was fantastic (again nothing overly special) and still ended up waiting for it forever after our meal.    Wouldn't go back and wouldn't recommend it. Maybe it's better for the cocktails!,268,"['feel', 'like', 'stars', 'pretty', 'generous', 'review', 'place', 'first', 'service', 'horrible', 'think', 'saw', 'waitress', 'ordered', 'eventually', 'track', 'manager', 'get', 'check', 'left', 'cash', 'didnt', 'wait', 'longer', 'chicken', 'waffle', 'way', 'overpriced', 'fried', 'chicken', 'one', 'waffle', 'nothing', 'exciting', 'flavoring', 'anything', 'fried', 'chicken', 'syrup', 'nice', 'touch', 'worth', 'fried', 'chicken', 'waffle', 'menu', 'small', 'brunch', 'menu', 'lot', 'options', 'luckily', 'seated', 'next', 'kitchen', 'seeing', 'anything', 'husband', 'liked', 'saw', 'burger', 'come', 'kitchen', 'asked', 'waitress', 'reluctant', 'bring', 'us', 'dinner', 'menu', 'told', 'us', 'thing', 'could', 'order', 'burger', 'afternoon', 'morning', 'continued', 'see', 'sandwiches', 'dinner', 'items', 'come', 'kitchen', 'waiting', 'food', 'poached', 'egg', 'dish', 'odd', 'overpowering', 'lemon', 'flavor', 'sauce', 'ruined', 'whole', 'dish', 'burger', 'super', 'greasy', 'ordered', 'peach', 'cobbler', 'instantly', 'cause', 'friends', 'tell', 'us', 'fantastic', 'nothing', 'overly', 'special', 'still', 'ended', 'waiting', 'forever', 'meal', 'wouldnt', 'go', 'back', 'wouldnt', 'recommend', 'maybe', 'better', 'cocktails']", feel like stars pretty generous review place first service horrible think saw waitress ordered eventually track manager get check left cash didnt wait longer chicken waffle way overpriced fried chicken one waffle nothing exciting flavoring anything fried chicken syrup nice touch worth fried chicken waffle menu small brunch menu lot options luckily seated next kitchen seeing anything husband liked saw burger come kitchen asked waitress reluctant bring us dinner menu told us thing could order burger afternoon morning continued see sandwiches dinner items come kitchen waiting food poached egg dish odd overpowering lemon flavor sauce ruined whole dish burger super greasy ordered peach cobbler instantly cause friends tell us fantastic nothing overly special still ended waiting forever meal wouldnt go back wouldnt recommend maybe better cocktails,137,0.5111940298507462,feel like star pretty generous review place first service horrible think saw waitress ordered eventually track manager get check left cash didnt wait longer chicken waffle way overpriced fried chicken one waffle nothing exciting flavoring anything fried chicken syrup nice touch worth fried chicken waffle menu small brunch menu lot option luckily seated next kitchen seeing anything husband liked saw burger come kitchen asked waitress reluctant bring u dinner menu told u thing could order burger afternoon morning continued see sandwich dinner item come kitchen waiting food poached egg dish odd overpowering lemon flavor sauce ruined whole dish burger super greasy ordered peach cobbler instantly cause friend tell u fantastic nothing overly special still ended waiting forever meal wouldnt go back wouldnt recommend maybe better cocktail,feel like star pretti generous review place first servic horribl think saw waitress order eventu track manag get check left cash didnt wait longer chicken waffl way overpr fri chicken one waffl noth excit flavor anyth fri chicken syrup nice touch worth fri chicken waffl menu small brunch menu lot option luckili seat next kitchen see anyth husband like saw burger come kitchen ask waitress reluct bring u dinner menu told u thing could order burger afternoon morn continu see sandwich dinner item come kitchen wait food poach egg dish odd overpow lemon flavor sauc ruin whole dish burger super greasi order peach cobbler instant caus friend tell u fantast noth over special still end wait forev meal wouldnt go back wouldnt recommend mayb better cocktail,"['feel', 'like', 'star', 'pretti', 'generous', 'review', 'place', 'first', 'servic', 'horribl', 'think', 'saw', 'waitress', 'order', 'eventu', 'track', 'manag', 'get', 'check', 'left', 'cash', 'didnt', 'wait', 'longer', 'chicken', 'waffl', 'way', 'overpr', 'fri', 'chicken', 'one', 'waffl', 'noth', 'excit', 'flavor', 'anyth', 'fri', 'chicken', 'syrup', 'nice', 'touch', 'worth', 'fri', 'chicken', 'waffl', 'menu', 'small', 'brunch', 'menu', 'lot', 'option', 'luckili', 'seat', 'next', 'kitchen', 'see', 'anyth', 'husband', 'like', 'saw', 'burger', 'come', 'kitchen', 'ask', 'waitress', 'reluct', 'bring', 'u', 'dinner', 'menu', 'told', 'u', 'thing', 'could', 'order', 'burger', 'afternoon', 'morn', 'continu', 'see', 'sandwich', 'dinner', 'item', 'come', 'kitchen', 'wait', 'food', 'poach', 'egg', 'dish', 'odd', 'overpow', 'lemon', 'flavor', 'sauc', 'ruin', 'whole', 'dish', 'burger', 'super', 'greasi', 'order', 'peach', 'cobbler', 'instant', 'caus', 'friend', 'tell', 'u', 'fantast', 'noth', 'over', 'special', 'still', 'end', 'wait', 'forev', 'meal', 'wouldnt', 'go', 'back', 'wouldnt', 'recommend', 'mayb', 'better', 'cocktail']",0.026397515527950305,21,0.16030534351145037,126

Pretty relax place with several couches to relax and sip a drink. Everything we tried was excellent. Many of the items are huge and should be shared.

Justin was our server for the night and he did an outstanding job, he had good recommendations, was very informative, and didn't talk to us like we were just another tourist table. He was very on top of drinks (which is huge for me) and checked in with us an appropriate amount of times without making it feel like he was hovering over our table. THE FOOD WAS TO DIE FOR, we both have ribs and they were amazing and perfectly cooked. I was told i had to try the bourbon blackberry lemonade and that was also amazing. The Manager even stopped by to see how everything was, and i can't tell you enough how important it is to feel that management presence in a restaurant.

For some reason I expected greens or something underneath it but the bulk of the dish was corn and chimichurri, which isn't the end of the world by any means.

Without even trying their food, I already fell in love with this place.  We walked in and sat at the bar.  The bartender was SO friendly and made our whole experience wonderful!  I decided to go out on a limb and try their Caiparinha.

The hummus at SH also was very cold and obviously had been refrigerated for who knows how long.  Rice - I give the nod to Zaytoon for true basmati rice and bigger serving.  Kabobs - Tie. They both are juicy and flavorful. Delicious.  Ambience - while SH is more of a true restaurant, once again I am subjected to incessant music playing at too high a volume. It's bad enough that they play only wimpy Lilith Fair songs one after the other, but then periodically an ad gets played as well. Quite annoying to hear a silly ad for Jack in the Box in the middle of your meal. If you don't mind the half-market apperanace of Zaytoon, then this one is also a tie.

nUpz0YiBsOK7ff9k3vUJ3A,"""Buddy V's Ristorante""",2.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"We had a reservation there a few weeks ago and were seated right away.  Service was attentive -at first. We got our drinks, went straight to the entrée. After that, our server wasn't very present. The chicken Marsala was pretty good; however, the pasta carbonara was very rich. My friend ordered it and I felt overwhelmed after two bites. Dessert was wonderful -we got the lobster tail and it was decadent. Great flavor and texture. The pit of night was when our waitress, Kacey, dropped the bill and told us the gratuity was already added so all we had to do was pay the total noted at the bottom.    The problem there was that we were a party of . We looked at the bill and printed directly on there was something along the lines of: ""No gratuity has been added to your bill. For your convenience, here are some preset gratuity amounts, just circle the one you'd like to apply. - % - % - % - %""  Kacey had circled the % option and wrote the new total at the bottom because I guess she thought that that was what she deserved. After she dropped the bill, we noticed she was constantly circling our table, waiting for us to provide a method of payment. We were a party of  and even though we are young (early s) we know how to tip. It was pretty insulting. I get it, you work in the heart of Vegas where many international visitors aren't aware of the customs. But that doesn't mean assume everybody is like that. After talking it over amongst ourselves, I got her attention and pointed out what the receipt stated and said that if it says that, then the gratuity amount should really be up to our discretion. She tried to cover it all up by saying something like, ""Oh, that was just a suggested amount, if it's that big of a deal I can just take it off."" And she ripped off the bottom of the check.    I've worked in the restaurant industry and servers face heavy disciplinary action for that type of behavior. We still left a tip but the whole ordeal really just left a bad taste in our mouths.",377,"['reservation', 'weeks', 'ago', 'seated', 'right', 'away', 'service', 'attentive', 'first', 'got', 'drinks',

XnJeadLrlj9AZB8qSdIR2Q,"""Joël  Robuchon""",5.0,Las Vegas,NV,89109,"When you were a kid and first learned about the concept of fine dining, this restaurant is probably what you imagined in your mind. Lots of modern fine dining places feel a bit understated - Benu, the French Laundry, Quince, and Saison all come to mind - in their service and interiors, as if to suggest that all of your attention should be on the food. You will not feel that way at all walking into this revered establishment. If Louis XIV had a dining room from Versailles transported into the modern era this is what it might feel like. Bold purple and white colors dominate the main dining space with a tasteful ivy wall serving for contrast against the far wall - the interior broadcasts luxury before you even walk into the space.  I've been fortunate enough to dine here on multiple occasions and every element of the restaurant is best-in-class. Don't believe anyone who think this place has fallen out favor or changed, it is still the best place to eat in all of Las Vegas.  There are a number of food options to choose from but c'mon, if you're here you're doing it wrong if you don't opt for the  course degustation menu. It's expensive but trust me, it's worth it. Obviously the menu shifts various dishes in and out but some delicious regulars include La Langoustine, a remarkable lobster ravioli, an amazing preperation of the classic French scallop dish La Noix De Saint-Jacques (I've never had better), and the real star of the show, Le Caviar, a trio of the finest caviar dishes; even if you're not a caviar fan I guarantee this dish will change your mind entirely. The night begins with and is complimented with an over-the-top bread cart full of every kind of freshly baked bread you can imagine but the true piece de resistance as it relates to American palettes is the bacon bread - trust me, you'll want many of these before your meal is over.  I know the image I painted of this place is of an extremely classy fine dining restaurant and that can be intimidating to some. While it most certainly is that they also go out of their way to make each and every guest here feel amazing. Instead of feeling like you are out of place in a luxury fine  dining restaurant the staff do everything they can from the moment you walk in until the moment you leave to make your experience be as memorable and great as it can be.

sN-EtbzAnEI9ilHruasd9w,"""Tennesseasonings""",4.0,Las Vegas,NV,89113,"I found out about their grand opening through Twitter. Their website boasts East TN BBQ. Having had some excellent BBQ just outside of Knoxville (and later trying another place that was just OK), I was looking forward to what Tennesseasonings had to offer.  We showed up around pm and they already ran out of chicken and baby back ribs. Not a good sign for your grand opening. Or maybe it is a good sign and they had a nice lunch rush.  We decided to get a ""Plate ."" to share ( meats and  sides) for about $. We chose pulled pork and chicken sausage along with green beans, greens, and baked beans.  The sausage and the sides were all good but the pork stood out for me. It's been a while since I've had good pulled pork. I tend to avoid ordering it because I find it's usually just dry pork that needs a lot of BBQ sauce to help it along. I appreciated that their pulled pork was chunkier and was more juicy.  All the sauces were on the side and it was interesting that they have a Carolina style mustard sauce. It turns out that they are from Chattanooga (possibly my favorite city in TN) and their BBQ is influenced by their neighboring states (AL\/GA\/NC\/SC). Granted I know nothing of Carolina BBQ, but we'll be traveling there in August, so I'll consider that a preview.  I still need to go back to try their baby back ribs, but I'm going with  preliminary stars.

though it was filled to the brim with seafood and a scoop or rice. it comes with this creamy tomato based sauce with a little kick of spice at the end. comes with a bunch of shrimp, mussels, clams,

Anyway, I came here with my friend yesterday for some Pho. This is her normal spot and my first time here. I set one foot in the door the the lady had two menus in her hand already and asked ""Two?"". Yes, but when did you even see us?! Whatever. We were seated IMMEDIATELY is what I`m getting at here and that was just fine with me. We were brought water twice(as in TWO glasses of water EACH), which was a little odd, but I figured they just didn`t want to fuss with refilling our water? Who knows. I didn`t care much about that oddity. Within about  minutes they came to take our order and luckily, I always know what I want. Gimmie the Pho, number , the one with the rare cow that cooks in the broth. You know.  Also, a Sapporo, please and thanks.   They brought my cold beer out pretty quickly but the glass wasn't cold(I know, I know. I like fancy touches, but still.) Sapporo as expected. Pho came out pretty soon after that with all the sides. I got a small and it was still pretty large. I love Pho and the bang for your buck that you get. Big bowl of broth, noodles(LOTS of noodles at this particular place), and some meat. I will say that there wasn't enough meat to satisfy my little carnivore heart, but it is what it is. The broth was AMAZING, which more than made up for the lack of meat. Add some lime to that bowl of broth = totally drinkable. So good! Some of the best Pho broth I have ever had. Noodles were..noodles. Overall, I would come back here. I found the service to be okay. They didn`t offer me another beer which was a little sad, but also helped me minimize my day drinking.",334,"['im', 'phoking', 'hungry', 'make', 'joke', 'anytime', 'know', 'pho', 'schedule', 'day',

My meat was ordered medium and the color was just right--a bit of pink in the middle--but I was blown away by how tender it was. I ate at the House of Prime Rib in San Francisco about a year ago and the rib I had at Ellis Island was just as good, if not better. And for only $!!

We sat in the bar area and the bartender\/server had very little patience for us while ordering (even tho the bar was fairly empty). After I ordered, I just asked if he can make sure we have carrots and celery, and I always ask Bc servers have forgotten about them before and he very rudely said yeah, they always come with it. So the food comes out, and he checks on us once. As we were finishing up, we asked for boxes, which took him a while to get bc he was on his phone before giving us the boxes!! then he constantly kept checking on our checks to see if they were ready. we had \/ payments out and the other two were getting their cards out and he didn't have the patience to wait just a few seconds. And I KNOW they do military discount but he couldn't give us it bc there was ""no manager present"", which sure that may be true, but it makes no sense to not honor it.. what if he had a void, cuz I know those need a manager for that?? And even if that was the case, he was very rude about it and we had  members in the group in the military..  I understand most people don't like to deal with ""drunk"" people but we werent even drunk or rude. Just a few young adults tryna get some chicken wings.

After a short crash course on how the menu works, I was pleasantly surprised to learn I got to choose FOUR different types of protein, so I made the most of it.  I chose a bowl with yellowtail, ahi, spicy tuna, and salmon. I moved onto the toppings, then got stuck on which sauce I wanted. Wondering out loud, the guy behind the counter said ""you can have whatever you want"".  So, I chose two - spicy ponzu and miso. The bowl was absolutely delicious. The spicy tuna didn't have that mealy consistency I've experienced at other place, and the fish was so fresh, as were all the toppings. The service was great.

I want to say there is at least - people there around -TBD.  Even if you aren't a local I recommend this place to get away from the strip and see an awesome sports bar!

Yes, you weren't confused. Even on a THURSDAY night this place can draw in quite the crowd.  I'm still kind of confused on the -star rating because this place deserves nothing, but  stars. I brought my friend from San Diego (who use to live in Vegas) and she was pretty blown away at this place. She didn't know there were bars like this outside of the downtown area. The best way for me to describe this place is that it's very similar to Gold Spike without having to deal with downtown traffic. It looks like a decked out back yard party that someone decided to throw while the parents are out of town.  Anyways, they've got the outdoor area with picnic tables for playing beer pong, heater lamps (for those cold winter-y nights), corn hole boards, ping pong tablets, a dj, and a bar. Inside they have even MORE seating, a few arcade games, another bar, and a mini bowling alley. I also believe that's some darts in the far end of the room you can play.  I've gone here several times and will continue coming back several more times. I've always had awesome service and some unforgettable nights here. If you're in town for St. Patrick's Day or Cinco de Mayo, this place really knows how to celebrate those holidays.  I also have to praise this bar for having my favorite gin, Hendrick's.

I usually would turn around and leave anywhere else, but there are not that many Lebanese restaurants in Vegas, so I decided to give it a go.  Apps: It was happy hour between  and , so most of the apps were \/ off. We ordered fattoush, tabouli, hummus, baba ganoush, meat grape leaves, and veggie grape leaves.  Everything was pretty good except the tabouli had too much dressing and could have been mixed with some more bulgar wheat. The fattoush was pretty good and it had enough sumac in it too. Some people don't put enough sumac in their fattoush.  Iced Tea - I think they put rose water in their tea. It was pretty good.  Entrees:  Chicken shawarma plate. It came with hummus and real Lebanese style garlic sauce. The chicken was not cooked on the proper vertical rotisserie, but it was spiced properly and it tasted very good.  Lamb Kabob - my daughter ordered it well done, so she basically ruined the meat, so I didn't bother to try it. It was a nice presentation though with the rice and veggies.  Falafel plate - they were good. Served with the traditional tahini sauce.  The service was great. It should be, we were the only customers there. The dining room decor reminded me of the Arabic restaurants back home in Dearborn from the 's. I liked it. Some might find it a bit dated though. I don't know why it was not busy, but I recommend you stop by and try some Lebanese cuisine.

The staff is all super nice and I love that this place is small and their small staff consists of all different ethnicities. Not the norm I've seen in smaller places, especially bakeries! The decor is absolutely beautiful, it reminds me of a place in San Diego.. My daughter and I decided to have brunch and I had their bacon and Swiss quiche with tossed salad and it was delectable!  My daughter had one of their specials, the Burger, hashbrowns and egg sandwich with their fresh fruit. She was asked how she'd like her egg done and ordered it over medium, but it was sunny side up...but she did eat it and enjoyed it. Overall this place is a must visit! I will definitely be back soon!

It is very diverse, but also was unappealing and in my honest opinion not very tasty. I like to destroy several plates at a buffet, but here... I only did  dish. I wasn't motivated to seek or eat more. Very unfortunate, because the service was decent here. But that doesn't make up for the meal.  I had the assorted seafood, sushi, mixed veggies and some steak. The crab legs were opened which was cool, but very small in proportion. You'd need several to feel like you're eating something. The sushi, as expected, was fishy and the rice was hard from coldness and sitting around. The steak was chewy (I didn't expect it to be filet or anything), and also not flavorful. Everything made my stomach... apathetic, to say?  Nothing here is specifically awful, but for a place as exquisite as the MGM, I would have expected much better out of them.

It has always been a great experience. We have always had a memorable time. And we drive from Summerlin. So needless to say, we kinda go out of our way to be there. So tonite we decide to check out the early Happy Hour. Wow, what a different experience. You'd think we were two people with leprosy considering the way we were totally ignored by Karla. We sat at the bar in the very middle. Over a two hour period we had several drinks. Each time I had to flag her down to place an order. We've sat at other bars in the far corner and received better service.   We gave Karla the benefit of the doubt until it came to getting the bill. We were charged normal price when we clearly ordered during happy hour. I tried my best to bring it to her attention, but my efforts were all in vain. So after I wrote on the receipt what the correct amounts should've been, I left leaving $. for a tip. I'm a very generous tipper, ask any of my regular bartenders at PT's.

But the next time I go there I will turn around and walk out of Karla is on duty. It I could title this post, it would have to be, ONE REGRET....We will stick to the late night happy hours for sure! And BTW, the chicken strips with ranch are awesome!  UPDATE Shawn, thank you for taking time to provide a thoughtful response. You're right, we are all human and errors & misunderstanding can occur. We do miss hanging out at your establishment and will be back very soon! I'll be sure to ask for you, it would be a pleasure to meet you. Thank you.

hCsJv234v62MgdsUU1j8dQ,"""Big Sur Oyster Bar""",1.0,Las Vegas,NV,89183,"I used to enjoy the food here and loved to come here as a local. My husband and I always take visiting relatives here, especially when we encourage them to stay at the South Point Hotel. I usually get the Seafood Diavolo, and always the calamari appetizer. Unfortunately, after my experience last night, I will never be back. I have tried almost everything on the menu, and the only thing that was subpar was the crab and avocado salad. Last night, my mom (who is visiting from California) and I met my aunt and uncle and cousin from Hawaii here since they are staying at the hotel. I told them they had to try it because it was surprisingly delicious. I ordered calamari for the table, which was extremely rubbery in texture. I was the only one eating it after everyone tried a piece. My mom had some clam chowder which was obviously decent. We decided to share the TWENTY-SIX dollar lobster grilled cheese. It was nothing close to a grilled cheese. The bottom piece of bread was so soggy, the inside contents of the ""grilled cheese"" seemed to have little or no cheese, and it tasted awful. I honestly do not believe that there was any real lobster inside. For the side, it came with stale kettle chips that seem to be house made...maybe earlier in the week? My cousin ordered the crab for $ which came out barely warm, with an unlit candle for the butter sauce. My aunt had fish and chips which also came out hardly warm fries, and luckily the fish was hot. My uncle had the scampi and he said it was good. Our service was nothing special and we never received any refills. The calamari came out so late that it wasn't really considered an appetizer. I felt bad that my aunt and uncle insisted on picking up the bill, but I was more so embarrassed that I had told them to try this place more than once, and the quality of the food and service was pretty awful. I am very disappointed. I feel bad for people who stay here and decide to ""splurge"" on a decent meal, since the prices aren't very reasonable. I still am in shock that the grilled cheese was so bad and came with stale kettle chips for almost $. It should be removed from the menu ASAP.",401,"['used', 'enjoy', 'food', 'loved', 'come', 'local', 'husband', 'always', 'take', 'visiting', 'relatives', 'especially', 'encourage', 'stay', 'south',
